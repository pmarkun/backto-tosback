We do not sell, rent,  share or disclose personal information to third parties without your prior  consent, except in the circumstances described in this Privacy Statement.  In addition, your ability to make informed  choices about the uses of your information is important to us. This privacy  statement explains our policy regarding the collection, use, disclosure and  protection of personal information. The links below provide detailed  information about our privacy practices:\n\n\n  What  is Personal Information? \n    Collection  of Personal Information \n    Use  of Personal Information by Costco \n    Sharing  of Personal Information \n    \n      Order  Fulfillment \n        Member  Services \n        Our  Contractors \n        Primary  Account Holder \n        Tobacco  Rebates for Business Members\n      \n    Other  Uses and Disclosures \n    Protection  of Personal and Credit Card Information \n    Choice \n    Health  Care Centers \n    \n      Health  Care Centers \n        Pharmacies\n      \n    Online Specifics\n    \n      Online  Information Gathering and Use \n        Links  to Other Web Sites\n        Updating,  Reviewing or Correcting Online Personal Information\n      \n    Apps/Mobile  Specifics\n    \n      SMS (Text) Messages\n        Costco Apps\n      \n    Use of the  Costco.com Site by Children\n    Questions or Concerns\n    Changes to this Statement\n  \nA. What is Personal Information? \nPersonal information is information that identifies an  individual or that can be reasonably associated with a specific person or  entity, such as a name, contact information, Internet (IP) address and information  about an individual&rsquo;s purchases and online shopping. Personal information also  includes medical information collected through our pharmacies, hearing aid  centers and optical centers (see Health Care  Centersbelow). As a convenience to our Members, we allow the  primary cardholder to add his/her spouse or others to a membership account. \nB. Collection of Personal Information \nWe collect the personal information that you provide us,  such as when you:\nsign up for or renew your Costco membership; \n  register to use costco.com or sign up for news or notifications of specials or other promotions on costco.com; \n  place an order or purchase products or services, online or otherwise; \n  contact us for any reason;\n  participate in a survey or promotion; or \n  sign up for or participate in our various Member Services (see Member Services below). \nWe may automatically collect some information when you visit  our website, such as your computer's IP address and operating system, the site  from which you linked to us, your site activity, the time and date of your  visit, and your purchases. This information may be collected through the use of  \"cookies\" and web beacons (see Online  Specifics below). We also receive information from third parties who  help us correct our records, prevent fraud, and provide Member Services or  special promotions or products (see Member  Services below).  We may combine any of this information with  the other personal information we maintain about you. \nC. Use of Personal Information by Costco\nThe personal information we collect is generally used to  process your requests or transactions, provide you with high-quality service,  tell you about opportunities we think will be of interest and administer your account,  including distribution of our own surveys and publications. For example, we may: \nAlert you about product recalls or safety  issues; \n  Communicate membership opportunities and  programs; and \n  Provide you with promotional information, such  as coupons, offers and product recommendations, or information about Member  Services (\"Promotional Information\"). If you prefer not to receive  Promotional Information from us, we make it easy for you to let us know. You  may contact us at any time to decline Promotional Information (see Choice below).\nD. Sharing of Personal Information\nWe share information in these circumstances:\n\n  \n    Order Fulfillment \n      We may provide to a third party  information as necessary to fulfill an order you have placed  with us. For example, we may provide your address to a shipper, and if you pay by  a credit or debit card, your card number and sales transaction information are  passed to the card processor and/or issuer (including their service providers  such as fraud verification services). However, we give suppliers, and others  involved in the distribution chain only the information needed to provide you  the products or services you order, and we require them to keep the information  confidential and not to use it for other purposes. We are not responsible for  any information you provide directly to these parties, and we encourage you to  become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to  them.\n    \n    \n    Member Services \n      We offer special products and  services to our members through third parties, such as rebates, financial,  travel, insurance and other business and consumer services (\"Member  Services\"). We may share your name, postal address, email address and  membership status, number and type (\"Member Information\") with these  third parties in order to notify you of their offerings, to determine whether,  or at what level, you qualify for the products, offerings or services, and to  evaluate new and existing products, offerings or services. If you prefer that  we not share Member Information with third parties, you can contact us at any  time (see Choice below).\n      However, if you apply for or  request certain products, offerings or services, information you provide will  be shared directly with the third parties who will be providing the requested  products, offerings or services. If you apply for an American Express Card  through Costco, we will collect the application on behalf of American Express. \n      These third parties are required  to use personal information we share only to provide the requested services. We  are not responsible for any additional information you provide directly to  these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy  practices and policies before disclosing information to them. Information you  provide to third parties, may in turn be shared with us along with information  about your use of the services. In some cases, these third parties may require  as a condition of providing services to you that you authorize them to share  information with us. If we terminate our relationship with a third party,  information you provided to them may be returned to us, and we may provide that  information to a new third party offering the same or similar services. \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      Our Contractors \n        We may contract with others to  perform services on our behalf. For example, we might retain a company to  process credit card payments, ship merchandise, distribute emails, process  rebates or analyze data. If any of these service providers need access to your  personal information, we require them to use it only to perform the services for  us. We also require that they maintain the confidentiality of the information  and/or return the information to us when they no longer need it.\n      \n    \n    \n    \n       Primary  Account Holder \n        Each membership account has an individual  primary account holder who is authorized to designate and remove add-on members  and make other account management decisions.   We may disclose Personal Information that relates to activities  occurring under the account to the primary account holder.\n      \n    \n    \n    \n      Tobacco Rebates for Business Members \n        As a service to our Business  Members who purchase tobacco products for resale, we provide information to the  tobacco manufacturers' representative to process retail incentives. The information  we provide is the business Member's name, address, the brand name, and the  amount of tobacco products purchased. Pursuant to California law, if you are a  Business Member in California and you do not want us to disclose this  information on your behalf, you can notify us (see Choice below). \n    \n    \n  \nE. Other Uses and Disclosures\nIn addition, we may use or disclose personal information in  the good faith belief that we are lawfully authorized to do so, or that doing  so is reasonably necessary to protect you, to comply with legal process or  authorities, to respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or  personal safety of Costco Wholesale, our Members, our employees or the public. If  your membership was purchased for you as an employee benefit, we may share your  name, address and membership level (Gold Star, Business or Executive), but no  other personal information, with your employer. Information about our Members,  including personal information, may be disclosed or transferred as part of, or  during negotiations of, any merger or sale of company assets or acquisition. \nF. Protection of Personal and Credit Card Information\nWe have physical, administrative and technical security  measures in place to protect personal information from loss, misuse or  alteration while it is under our control. We are required to collect, process  and maintain payment card information in accordance with the data security  rules adopted by credit card companies such as Visa, MasterCard and American  Express. This means that we do not retain debit card PINs or credit card  security codes, and that any time we maintain a credit card number, such as  when you create an online account, we must limit access to it and use strong  encryption to protect it. Further, when you enter personal information online,  that information is encrypted prior to transmission using a security protocol  called SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). We also use SSL to allow you to securely  view your online account and registration information.\nOnline account information is accessible only by using a  password. You must keep your password confidential. You are responsible for all  uses of www.costco.com by anyone using  your password.  Please advise us  immediately at customerservice@costco.com if you believe your password has  been misused.\nG.

Your choice to opt-out will  not apply to your spouse and any add-on members.\n\n  \n    If you do not want us to share Member Information (see Member Services) with third parties, you       can: (a) check the opt-out box on our membership applications; (b) follow       the opt-out instructions on your renewal notices; (c) visit us at any       Membership desk at any U.S. or Puerto Rico Costco warehouse location; (d)       call our Membership Services representatives at 1-800-774-2678; (e) email       us at customerservice@costco.com; or (f) write us at:Customer Service, P.

Health Care Centers\n\n  \n    Health Care Centers \n      We appreciate the importance of  safeguarding the privacy of your personal health information and consequently  we have special procedures to protect this sensitive information provided to  our pharmacies, and optical and hearing aid departments (\"Health Care  Centers\"). Personal health information includes your prescription  information, your Pharmacy Patient Profile and other related information. Review  our Health Care Centers' Notice of Privacy Practices. If you are an Executive Member, your purchase  information from our Health Care Centers will be combined with your other  personal information to calculate your Executive Member 2% Reward, subject to  the terms and conditions of that program.\n    \n    \n    Pharmacies \n      This section explains our policy  with respect to the uses of personal pharmacy information, whether you use our  services online or in a warehouse pharmacy. Prescription information is stored  in an electronic system separate from all other member stored personal  information. To fill your prescriptions, we collect your name, address,  telephone number, age, gender, allergies, and other prescription-related  information. We are required by law to collect this type of information to  identify potentially dangerous drug interactions or other health concerns. We  use this information to process your order, contact you with any questions and  provide you with the counseling you may require. Our pharmacist database is  maintained separately from other Member databases. Only licensed pharmacists,  specifically authorized staff, and others permitted by law to view this  database, are allowed to do so. When you use our services, you consent to our  use and disclosure of your personal health information for purposes of  treatment, payment or health care operations. We do not otherwise sell, share,  rent or disclose personal information collected from our pharmacy pages or  maintained in pharmacist records unless you have authorized such disclosure, or  such disclosure is permitted or required by law. Additional terms regarding the  confidentiality of your prescription information are explained in our  confidentiality of personal pharmacy information page located on our Web site https://www2.costco.com/Pharmacy/RegPharmacy/PrivacyPolicyHealthCareConsent.aspx?lang=en-US and incorporated in this Privacy Policy by this reference. Please review these  terms so that you understand how they affect your actions and information. \n    \n  \nI. Online Specifics\n\n  \n    Information Gathering and Use.We use cookies.

Apps/Mobile Specifics\n\n  \n    SMS  (Text) Messages We will send you SMS (text)  communications only if you consent to receive them.

You may review our terms of SMS service here. \n    \n    \n    The Costco App \n      Before we collect or send location-specific  information, we will ask for your consent.   You may use the app without consenting to this, and you may withdraw  your consent by changing your selection within the app.  Your general consent to your mobile service  provider to allow (or disallow) location-based services does not automatically  apply to us. \n      In general, you do not need to  provide any personal information to use our app.  If you wish to make a purchase through the  app, however, you must create an account.   Personal information you provide is subject to this Costco.com Privacy  Statement.  In addition, as with any  online service, our app automatically collects information such as an IP  address, the unique identifier of your mobile device and the URL from which you  accessed our app (see Online Specifics).  Neither your name nor telephone number are  automatically collected. It is not possible to opt out of providing information  automatically collected through our apps.\n      Providers who supply the  technology necessary for us to create the app may share in the receipt of  automatically collected information. We restrict their use of personal information  to the purpose of providing services to Costco.   In addition, you should review the privacy statements published by your  mobile carrier and by your device manufacturer.   Either or both of them may automatically collect information.  Costco does not have access to information  you provide to or that is automatically collected by these third parties.\n      Our apps may provide links to  Costco service providers (see Member Services)  and other third parties (see Links to Other  Sites).\n      Except as described in this  Privacy Statement, Costco does not sell or share with third parties any  information you provide or information automatically collected through our app.\n    \n  \nK.
