Available product lines, shipping rates and fees may vary depending on the delivery address for your order.\n        You will be notified at checkout if certain items must be removed due to weight, size (too large to ship in one package) or import/export laws and regulations.  You must remove those items from your Shopping Bag before you can proceed to checkout. Your order will be completed by our shipping partner, I-PARCEL, who will convert our prices into your preferred currency, collect your payment information and estimate customs fees and import duties based on the country where your order will be delivered (the \"destination country\").  For international orders, your credit card information is only collected by I-PARCEL and is not shared with or collected by Redcats USA.  See the Privacy Policy of I-PARCEL.  If required by the destination country, I-PARCEL or its agent may request additional personal identifying information that must be provided to complete the delivery.  Such information will only be used for the purpose of processing your order.  If you do not agree to these terms and do not provide the information, your order cannot be processed.Once your order is complete, we will ship your order to I-PARCEL\u2018s New Jersey location, and then I-PARCEL will ship the order to you.  If we are not able to deliver your order, we will attempt to notify you of the problem using the email address you provided during checkout to notify you that your package has been deemed \"undeliverable\".

By placing your order, you authorize I-PARCEL, its employees and agents, to act as your agent with the customs and tax authorities in the destination country, to clear your merchandise, to process and remit your actual import fees for the items ordered.

It is possible that Customs clearance procedures can cause a shipment to be delivered beyond our original delivery estimates.\n        \n        Payment MethodsAvailable payment methods will be by credit cards and/or through PayPal as displayed on your checkout page.
