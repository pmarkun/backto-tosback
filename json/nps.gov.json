We use the information we collect to count the number and type of visitors to the different pages on our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors like you.\nIf You Send Us E-mail\nYou may choose to provide us with personal information, as in e-mail with a comment or question. We use the information to improve our service to you or to respond to your request. Sometimes we forward your e-mail to other government employees or authorized concessioners who may be better able to help you. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, we do not share our e-mail with any other outside organizations.\n\nLinks to Other Sites\nOur website has many links to our partners, especially other federal agencies.
