We also use Your information to deliver customized services to You.  Member login information and e-mail addresses may be disclosed to third parties for the purpose of providing certain features or third-party upgrades as requested by the Member.  We are not responsible for how third parties use your information, and You should become familiar with such third parties\u2019 privacy policies prior to requesting their services.

We additionally may use the personal information of Users whose membership has expired or has been cancelled in order to market Our services to these individuals in the future.\n            We generally will use Your information for the purposes for which You specifically provide it, for example, to ensure payment for subscription services, if applicable.  We also use Your information for market research purposes \u2013 in order to increase Your (and other Users\u2019) experience according to tracked interests, to analyze and target potential new markets, and for other marketing purposes.\n            We also use Your information for the obvious purpose of providing Your User profile to all of Our other Members and Browsers.  When You create a profile, You should consider all of the information on the profile to be public information, accessible by anyone, unless otherwise stated.  Even if You choose to not make public Your personally identifying information, You should understand that there is a possibility that You may be identified through information You provide on Your profile.  For example, You may be visually recognized by someone who sees Your picture or Your description may be adequately detailed that someone browsing the Site would be able to tell that the person is You.  Accordingly, You understand that using this Site places You in control of all of the information displayed on Your profile, and You are fully responsible for any consequences arising out of such information You choose to publish.\n            \n        \n    Special Cases.\n        It is Our policy not to use or share the personal information about Browsers or Members in ways unrelated to those described in this Policy without also providing You an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

We will absolutely provide Your information to the credit card holder if We believe that fraud is a possibility.  However, We do not require that there be fraud, as it is Our policy that the credit card holder always has an absolute right to access any and all of Your personal information.\n                    Anyone who violates Our Anti-Spam Policy, if applicable, shall have their personal information made public. If there is any investigation on any unlawful spamming, or any use of bulk e-mail in order to promote Your User profile, or any use of bulk e-mail in any manner that leads back to Our Site, or any one of Our Sites, We will cooperate with any and all parties completely and freely in order to see that Your bulk e-mail activities stop.\n                \n        \n    Transmittals from Us\n        We may send You periodic announcements including the details of Our existing and new programs.

In having done so, You understand that even unsolicited commercial email sent from Us or Our affiliates is not SPAM as that term is defined under the law.\n        \n    Public Areas\n        Any information provided in a User profile, blog, profile post, Member directory, chat room, or other related service should be considered to be public information. We do not, cannot, and will not act to maintain the privacy of any information that You provide in any such forum or medium.\n        \n    Our Commitment to Data Security\n        We take measures to protect the transmission of all sensitive end-user information.  We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of Our network and systems.  Nevertheless, We cannot guarantee that Our security measures will prevent third-party \u2018hackers\u2019 from illegally obtaining this information.  We take all reasonable measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-criminals, We are unable to guarantee that Our security is one hundred percent (100%) breach-proof.  You assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite Our reasonable security measures.\n        \n    How to Access or Modify Your Information\n        We may offer our Members the opportunity to access or modify information provided during registration.
