Technologies used to collect this click stream data include cookies and Web beacons.\r\nIn order to improve performance, we augment our click stream data with non-personally-identifiable behavioral and demographic data from Digital Content Providers and other partners. This anonymous data may include such things as postal code, age and gender.  It may also include GPS location provided by Digital Content Providers with mobile properties.\r\nPersonally Identifiable Information Collected By Our Tech Bargains ServiceTech Bargains is a consumer-facing site where you may sign up to get alerts on discount deals.
