Usage Information may include the browser and  operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to  our Site or content, all of the areas within our Site that you visit, including  items that you browse, the time of day, and the preceding page viewed, among  other information.We may use Usage  Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise  improve the Site and our services.\u00a0 In  addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier  (\u201cDevice Identifier\u201d) for any  computer, mobile phone or other device (any, a \u201cDevice\u201d) you may use to access a Site. A Device Identifier is a  number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access a Site, and  our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service  providers may also provide us or our third party service providers with  information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access a  Site. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if Redbox associates  it with you as a specific and identifiable person, Redbox treats it as Personal  Information.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe methods that may be used to collect Usage Information include the following:\nCookies.
