Generally, if a business has disclosed personal information regarding its California customers to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year, the business is required to provide, upon request and free of charge, a list of the names and addresses of all such third parties, together with a list of the categories of personal information that was disclosed.  The \"Shine The Light\" law creates an exception, however, for businesses that adopt and disclose to the public (in their privacy policies) a policy of not sharing personal information for direct marketing purposes without offering their customers choices to prevent such disclosures. These businesses are not obligated to provide the list described above and may respond to requests from California customers by notifying them of their rights to prevent disclosures of personal information for direct marketing purposes and providing a cost-free means of exercising those rights.  We qualify for this latter exception. If you are a California resident, you may request an information-sharing disclosure from us by emailing your request to CustomerService@UnderArmour.com.  Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per California customer during the course of any calendar year and we reserve the right not to respond to requests made by means other than through the contact information provided above.To help us achieve our goal of providing the highest quality products and services, we use information from our interactions with you and other customers, as well as information from certain third parties. Because we respect your privacy, we have procedures to ensure that your personal information is handled in a responsible manner. We have posted this Privacy Statement on our website to let you know what kind of information we collect, the purposes for which we collect and use the information, how it is handled, with whom it may be shared, and what choices you have regarding our use of your information.Except where separate privacy terms are specified, this Privacy Statement applies to all information we collect or acquire from and about consumers through all media, channels and platforms, whether online, offline, print, telephonic, mobile, wireless, or otherwise, and whether existing now or in the future, including, without limitation through: (i) UA.com, UnderArmour.com, and other websites owned, controlled or operated by us, including mobile versions of these websites; (ii) Under Armour-branded \"consumer experience\" channels, pages, and applications (including mobile applications, widgets, applets, plug-ins, etc.) that are hosted on third-party sites and platforms, including those hosted on third-party social media sites (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, and Google/YouTube); (iii) events and promotions sponsored or hosted by us, whether alone or jointly with others (e.g., sweepstakes, contests, giveaways, sales promotions, athletic events, etc.); and (iv) other data collection, acquisition and marketing channels (e.g., direct mail, paper and phone enrollments, cross-sell programs, loyalty programs, and affiliate marketing).As we continue to develop our website and take advantage of advances in technology, our Privacy Statement may change. Please refer to this page frequently for the most up-to-date information.WHAT ARE YOUR SECURITY AND PRIVACY POLICIES?SECURE ORDERING:We go to great lengths to protect your personal information. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry-standard encryption technology that ensures safe internet transmission of your personal information. When the letters \"http\" in the URL change to \"https,\" the \"s\" indicates you are in a secure area employing SSL; also, your browser may give a pop-up message stating that you're about to enter or leave a secure area. Using a browser that is SSL capable will ensure that your information is encoded/encrypted when it is sent over the internet. When you see VeriSign's logo on our secure checkout pages, be assured that your information is being transmitted to our secure servers. Ultimately, if you register an account with our website, your account and personal information is protected by the password you provide when you created your account. Always keep this password and login information private, and never share it with anyone. Also, remember to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or an Internet caf\u00c3\u00a9.Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet and no data storage can be 100% secure. Consequently, while we endeavor to safeguard your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure, we do not warrant or guarantee the absolute security of any personal information you transmit to, from or through our website. We will notify you in the event we become aware of a security breach involving your personal information stored by or for us.
