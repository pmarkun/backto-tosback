In particular, You are advised that the United States of\r\n\t\t\tAmerica uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation,\r\n\t\t\tgovernmental regulation, and self-regulation. Article 26 of the European Union's Data\r\n\t\t\tProtection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of\r\n\t\t\tpersonal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has\r\n\t\t\tunambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of\r\n\t\t\tthe third country's level of protection. By agreeing to the terms of use and this privacy\r\n\t\t\tpolicy, You consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of\r\n\t\t\tAmerica, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the\r\n\t\t\tEuropean Union and to the processing of that information by DOCSTOC on its servers\r\n\t\t\tlocated in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tCorrection/Updating Personally Identifiable\r\n\t\t\tInformation\r\n\t\tDOCSTOC provides You with the ability to review, correct,\r\n\t\t\tand delete any of Your user profile.
