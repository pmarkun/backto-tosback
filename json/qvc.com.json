As part of that commitment, we gather information about our customers, users of our \r\n            websites and other services, and visitors so we can better serve you.

Whether you visit or buy from our show, one of our stores, or one of our websites such as QVC.com, or through one of \r\n            our other services such as QVC's mobile services or a QVC software application (i.e., a widget) downloaded to your desktop (all of which \r\n            together with our websites we will refer to as  \"services\"), you can be assured that we respect the confidentiality of personal information \r\n            that identifies you and treat that information responsibly.

We may change or add to this Privacy \r\n            Statement from time to time. When that happens, we will post the revised Privacy Statement here. Your use of one of our services after \r\n            changes to this Privacy Statement have been posted constitutes your knowledge and acceptance of those changes (i.e., that the changes may be \r\n            applied to the information we collect from and about you).\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            QVC is not responsible for the privacy or data collection policies or practices of the services from which you access our  services, of \r\n            services we link to, or of any services that are linked to our services.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            This Privacy Statement tells you what kinds of information we collect about our customers, users, and visitors, how we use that information \r\n            and with whom we may share it, and how you can access and change our information about you.

We collect the personal information that you give us voluntarily or in \r\n            response to our request when you choose to purchase a product from us or use one of our services. For example, when you register with QVC we \r\n            will ask you to provide information such as your name, e-mail address, physical address, and telephone number. Registration with QVC is \r\n            generally required to make a purchase or to use one of our community functions such as posting a message on a community forum or submitting a \r\n            product review. Similarly, we will ask you for contact information if you use our notify a friend program or if you request that we send you \r\n            e-newsletters or other promotional notices or seek information or assistance from us.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            If you purchase a product, we will also ask  you for financial information such as your QCard\u00ae or other credit card number and \r\n            for a billing address and a shipping address.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Additional personal information may be collected from you in connection with your use of certain optional services and features we offer. For \r\n            example, if you register for QVC's mobile services, we will ask you to provide information such as your cell phone number and the name of your \r\n            mobile provider, as well as the payment method, billing address, and shipping address you want to use for any purchases through this service. \r\n            You will also be requested to specify payment and shipping information in advance if you want to purchase items using a speed purchase feature. \r\n            Similarly, entering one of our contests or sweepstakes, submitting an employment application, or using one of our community functions may \r\n            involve our collection of further personal information from you such as your social security number and chosen nickname. If you sign up to \r\n            receive Today's Special Value\u00ae e-mails, messages or e-newsletters, you may be asked to provide information concerning your personal \r\n            interests. We may also collect personal information from your creation of wish lists or reminders.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            If  you are a member of one of our third party affinity programs, we may also collect personal information from you about your membership and \r\n            your purchases from us.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Return to top\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n            What other kinds of customer information do we collect?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            If you ask us to ship a purchase to somebody else or you use our notify a friend feature, we will ask you to provide the name and address or \r\n            e-mail address of the person to whom you are sending or recommending the product, as well as your name and contact information.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            We may also obtain personal information about you such as contact information, updated address and shipping instructions, and credit \r\n            information from agents, consultants, contractors, carriers, and other third parties. We may also collect contact and other information about \r\n            prospective customers.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Additionally, our system keeps track of technical information about your computer or mobile device, such as the browser type and version, \r\n            browser plug-in types and versions, and operating system of your computer, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) or other provider you use to \r\n            access certain of our services, and your internet protocol (ip) address, location, and time zone setting. To help us understand the use of our \r\n            services by our visitors and improve your shopping experience and to aid us in marketing and managing our services, we also automatically \r\n            collect information as to how you were directed to them, how you navigate around them, what products you browse, and your purchasing \r\n            activities.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Return to top\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n            How do we collect this information?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            When you register with QVC, we compile the personal information you give us about yourself into an individual profile, adding other personal \r\n            information about you to that profile as we obtain it. We also collect information about your purchases and other uses of our services as \r\n            they occur.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Personal and other information about prospective customers may be collected by us or obtained from our business partners or other third \r\n            parties.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            We automatically gather other information (including the technical information identified above) when you access certain of our services, \r\n            including through the use of cookies and web beacons.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Return to top\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n            How do we use cookies?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Cookies enhance our ability to serve you. Basically, they're pieces of text that a website stores on your computer \u2013 an identification \r\n            code of sorts. This cookie can be accessed by the website when you revisit it.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            We use two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies terminate shortly after you terminate your internet \r\n            session. Persistent cookies are stored on your hard drive until they expire or are deleted. Both types of cookies help provide an enhanced \r\n            user experience since they recall your use of the Internet and our services, shopping preferences, shopping cart information, and your \r\n            password.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            We understand that not everyone wants to permit the use of cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to \r\n            prevent your browser from accepting cookies and how to disable cookies, but we recommend that you leave cookies turned on so that you can \r\n            take full advantage of the shopping features we offer.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Return to top\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n            How do we use web beacons?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Web beacons are small, transparent graphics that are placed on web pages to track how visitors arrive at a website and what they do there. We \r\n            use web beacons to track customers' visits to and browsing activities at our websites and to compile sales and statistical data. For example, \r\n            beacons let us know when a purchase is made on one of our websites by a member of one of our third party affinity programs and when a purchase \r\n            is initiated by an advertisement we placed on a third party's website. This information assists us in marketing and managing our websites and \r\n            enhancing  your shopping experience.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Return to top\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n            What if you don't want to give us personal information?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Personal information is required for you to  make a purchase, request information or assistance, or take advantage of certain services and \r\n            features we offer, such as QVC's mobile services and desktop applications, our notify a friend feature, community functions, contests or \r\n            sweepstakes, or on-line employment applications. If you do not want to provide personal information through use of these services and \r\n            features, you are free to look for products offered through any of our marketing channels and place a telephone order by calling \r\n            1.888.345.5788 toll-free or by visiting one of our stores. We respect the confidentiality of all your personal information as described in \r\n            this Privacy Statement whether you give it to us over the telephone, at one of our stores, or via any other means.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Return to top\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\n            How do we protect our customers' personal information?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            QVC participates in the VeriSign Secured Seal Program.

This includes for example, contacting you to confirm your order, fulfilling it, and \r\n            shipping it. We may also contact you about your order.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Additionally, we will use your contact information to send you e-newsletters or other promotional notices, or to respond to requests for \r\n            information or assistance from you.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            If you are a member of one of our third party affinity programs, we will use and disclose your personal information to administer and manage \r\n            that program. Similarly, if you choose to participate in certain services or features we offer such as QVC's mobile services and desktop \r\n            applications, our notify a friend feature, community functions, contests or sweepstakes, and on-line employment applications, we will use \r\n            your personal information to administer and manage those services and features.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            We may also use your personal information to improve our service to you, to customize the content you see, and for research, marketing, and \r\n            other business purposes. For example, we periodically review customer information as part of servicing our accounts.

Similarly, if you order a product that is shipped directly from another company, or offered by us in \r\n            conjunction with another company, we will share personal information about that order with the other company.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            We may use third party agents, consultants, and contractors to perform business functions on our behalf, including customer service, credit \r\n            review, account servicing, customer research, marketing, provision of IT services, and records maintenance. We give these entities access to \r\n            our customers' personal information to perform these functions for us. We DO NOT authorize them to use that information for any other purpose.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            Additionally, we share personal information about you when you voluntarily use certain optional services and features we offer. For example, \r\n            if you are a member of one of our third party affinity programs, we will share information concerning your purchases from us with the \r\n            organization running that program. If you ask us to send a particular product to another person or use our notify a friend feature, we will \r\n            tell that person we are sending the product or e-mail at your request. If you participate in a contest or sweepstakes or submit an employment \r\n            application, we may share the information you submit with others assisting us in the administration of that feature. If you use one of our \r\n            community functions, the content of your posting will be available to all other participants and will be accompanied by your user name or \r\n            chosen nickname.\r\n        \r\n        \r\n            It is possible that QVC or part of its business or one of its affiliates could merge with, acquire or be acquired by another business entity \r\n            and your personal information could be among the assets transferred.
