This privacy policy (\u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) explains our information collection practices at usmagazine.com, other websites owned by us and our other interactive properties, including but not limited to our mobile websites and applications (each, an \u201cRS Application\u201d) and through offline means.  It explains the types of information we collect regarding users of the RS Application and subscribers to our magazine and how we may use that information so you can make an informed decision about whether to view the content and/or use our services (\"Services\").  Thus this Privacy Policy applies to information we collect via (1) the RS Application (however accessed and/or used, whether via personal computers, mobile devices or otherwise); (2) email or electronic newsletters; (3) offline means such as telephone and traditional mail; and (4) any other means or applications in which you connect with us.  \n\n\t\t\t\tThis Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the RS Application's Terms of Use. Each time that you access or use the RS Application you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by the Terms of Use, and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue using our Services.\n\n\t\t\t\t1.\tInformation That Is Collected \n\n\t\t\t\tWhen you provide us with information in connection with a particular activity, product or service or provide your contact information, including your email address or telephone number in connection with that activity, product or service, you expressly consent to our communicating with you about our products or services using the information you provided to us.  You also attest that you have the legal authority over any telephone number you provide to us and can provide us with the authorization to contact you.  This means we may contact you, in person or by recorded message, by e-mail, telephone and/or mobile telephone number (including use of automated dialing equipment), text (SMS) message, or any other means of communication that your wireless or other telecommunications device may be capable of receiving.\n\n\t\t\t\t(a) Information You Provide To Us\n\n\t\t\t\tPersonal Information.  We may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as personal information, which is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally, such as your name, gender, e-mail address, date of birth, physical address (or elements thereof such as zip code and state) (\u201cPersonal Information\u201d).  We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on the RS Application, including magazine subscription forms, account registration forms, contact us forms or when you otherwise interact with us.\n\n\t\t\t\tBilling and Credit Card Information.  To enable payment for subscriptions, we collect and store billing and credit card information.  This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction.  Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit cards.\n\n\t\t\t\tFacebook.  You may be given the option to link your Facebook account so that you can comment on the RS Application or take advantage of other features of the RS Application. When you comment on the RS Application using your Facebook username and password and clicking \"allow\" on the Facebook permission authorization screen, you give us permission to capture, store, use and display your Facebook user ID, your basic Facebook profile information and any other information from your Facebook profile that you specifically allow us to access. The authentication of your Facebook login credentials are conducted through Facebook.  \n\n\t\t\t\t(b)\tInformation Collected As You Access and Use the RS Application\n\n\t\t\t\tIn addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the RS Application (\u201cUsage Information\u201d).  This Usage Information may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to our RS Application, all of the areas within our RS Application that you visit, and the time of day, among other information.  We may use Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance or otherwise improve the RS Application.  In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier (\u201cDevice Identifier\u201d) for your computer or other device used to access the RS Application (any, a \u201cDevice\u201d) and may combine your Device Identifier with information from third party sources to identify your Device\u2019s location by state and region (\u201cRegion Location\u201d) or more specific information about your geographic location for certain RS Applications (\"Geolocation\"), as more clearly spelled out in this policy.  A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access the RS Application, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier.  Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you.  Whenever we associate Usage Information or a Device Identifier with your Personal Information, we will treat it as Personal Information.\n\n\t\t\t\tA few of the tracking technologies that may be used to collect Usage Information include, without limitation, the following:\n\n\t\t\t\tCookies.  A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the RS Application.  We use cookies to collect information for record keeping purposes, to make it easier to navigate the RS Application.  Cookies are stored on users\u2019 hard drives.  We use both \u201csession ID cookies\u201d and \u201cpersistent cookies.\u201d  Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the RS Application and expire when the user closes his/her browser.  Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the RS Application easier for returning users by remembering a user\u2019s login information.  Persistent cookies stay on a user\u2019s hard drive from one session to the next.  \u201cFlash cookies,\u201d known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your Device to personalize your visit.  Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information.  Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies, please click www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html.  If you choose to disable cookies on your Device, some features of the RS Application may not function properly.\n\n\t\t\t\tWeb Beacons.  Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as \u201c1x1 GIFs\u201d or \u201cclear GIFs\u201d) may be included in our web pages and messages.  Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon.  Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the RS Application, to monitor how users navigate the RS Application, to count how many e-mails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. \n\n\t\t\t\tEmbedded Scripts.  An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the RS Application, such as the links you click on.  The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the RS Application, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.\n\t\t\t\tHTML5. We use HTML5 in the Rolling Stone mobile website and certain mobile applications for the iphone or ipad (and any other Apple iOS device). HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies.  Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser \u201ccookies\u201d file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites.  To our knowledge there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.\n\t\t\t\tGeolocation RS Applications. For certain of the mobile RS Applications that have search functionality, we may, and may enable a third party such as an advertiser to, ask you if you wish us to collect your geolocation in order provide you with information about goods and services within your geographic location. If you agree to have your geolocation collected, we and the third party, if applicable, will maintain information about your geolocation to facilitate your searching.  In addition, when you have geolocation software running on your mobile phone, computer or other Device, we may collect that information as controlled by your privacy settings on those Devices.     \n\n\t\t\t\t(c)\tInformation You Provide About a Third Party \n\n\t\t\t\tIf you send someone else a communication from the RS Application, such as sending an invitation to a friend, the information you provide (names, e-mail addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise.  If that person becomes a subscriber to our magazine or newsletter, his/her information will be treated in the same manner as all other subscribers.  Please be aware that when you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on our RS Application, your e-mail address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.\n\n\t\t\t\t(d)\tInformation We Collect from Third Parties\n\t\t\t\tWe may acquire information from other trusted sources to update or supplement the information that you provided or we collected automatically, such as information to validate or update your address or other demographic information and lifestyle information.  We use this information to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect, to target our communications so that we can inform you of products, services and offers that may be of interest, and for internal business analysis or other business purposes.\n\n\t\t\t\t2.\tHow We Use and Share the Information Collected\n\n\t\t\t\t(a) Use of Information by Us.

We may use third party vendors to perform certain services on behalf of the RS Application, such as hosting the RS Application, designing and/or operating the RS Application\u2019s features, managing our email lists, fulfilling magazine subscriptions, processing payments, and performing other administrative services.  We may provide these vendors with access to user information, including Personal Information, to carry out the services they are performing for you or for us.  \n\n\t\t\t\t(h) Third Party Technologies.  We use third parties\u2019 tools to better understand who is using the RS Application and how, to provide certain functionalities on the RS Application, to improve the effectiveness of the RS Application and its content, and to help us serve more targeted advertising to you.  Those third party companies may use cookies, pixel tags or other technologies to collect and store anonymous information such as time of visit, pages visited, time spent on each page of the RS Application, Device Identifiers, Region Location, type of operating system used and other web sites you may have visited.  We do not have access to, nor control over, third parties' use of cookies or other tracking technologies.

We also use third-party ad servers and ad networks to serve advertisements when you visit the RS Application. These companies and the advertisers themselves may use information about your visits on other web sites and the RS Application in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements to the RS Application, these third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your Device, the advertisements and links that appear on the RS Application. They automatically receive your Device Identifier when this happens. They may also use tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such advertisers, ad servers or ad networks.  You should consult the respective privacy policies of any advertisers on the RS Application to see your options for opting out of their use of such devices. In addition, some of the ad servers and ad networks may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies.  If you opt-out of receiving targeted ads on the RS Application from ad servers and ad networks, you will continue to receive advertising and promotional messages after you opt-out, but they will not be customized or personalized to you based on your use of the RS Application and/or third party websites.  If you would like more information about advertisers' use of tracking technologies and about your option not to accept these cookies, you can go to www.networkadvertising.org.  If you would like to learn more about how interest-based information is collected, whether the companies we use are part of an industry network regarding behavioral advertising and to know your choices about not having information used in this manner you can go to www.aboutads.info.\n\n\t\t\t\t(j) Co-branded Areas.  Certain areas of the RS Application may be provided to you in association with third parties, such as retailers, sponsors or advertisers (\u201cCo-Branded Areas\u201d), and may request that you disclose Personal Information.  Such Co-Branded Areas will identify the third party.  If you elect to register for or purchase products and/or services at Co-Branded Areas, you may be providing your information to both us and the third party. Your personal information will be subject to this Privacy Policy as well as the privacy policy and practices of such third party.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of those third parties to learn more about their privacy practices.\n\n\t\t\t\t(k) Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions. We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (any, a \u201cPromotion\u201d) that may require registration.  By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to official rules that govern that Promotion.  If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion\u2019s official rules.\n\n\t\t\t\t(l) Administrative and Legal Reasons.

Further, we may use Device Identifiers and other information to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with third parties such as copyright owners, internet service providers, wireless service providers and/or law enforcement agencies, including disclosing such information to third parties, all in our discretion.  Such disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.\n\t\t\t\t(m) Sale or Transfer of Business or Assets.  We may share your information, including your Personal Information and Usage Information with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates for internal business purposes.  In addition, in the event that we, or any of our businesses, are sold or disposed of as a going concern, whether by merger, sale of assets or otherwise, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, Personal Information may be one of the assets sold or merged in connection with that transaction.  Information about our visitors and registered users may also need to be disclosed in connection with a commercial transaction where we or any one of our businesses are seeking financing, investment, support or funding.  In such transactions, use of such information will be subject to the rights and obligations as described in this Privacy Policy.    \n\n\t\t\t\t3.\tInformation You Disclose Publicly\n\n\t\t\t\tThe RS Application may permit you to submit photographs, user profiles, writings, music, video, questions, comments or other content, which may include Personal Information (collectively, \u201cUser Content\u201d).

We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any content or information that you disclose or receive through the RS Application.  For the full terms and conditions regarding User Content you submit to the RS Application, please review our Terms of Use.\n\n\t\t\t\t4.\tThird Party Content and Links To Third Party Sites\n\n\t\t\t\tThe RS Application may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect RS Application usage information and your Device Identifier when web pages from the RS Application are served to your browser.  In addition, when you are on the RS Application you may be directed to other web sites that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or third party web sites.  For example, if you \u201cclick\u201d on a banner advertisement, the \u201cclick\u201d may take you off the RS Application onto a different web site.  These other web sites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit Personal Information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies.  We encourage you to note when you leave our RS Application and to read the privacy statements of all third party web sites before submitting any Personal Information to those sites.\n\n\t\t\t\t5.\tConsent to Transfer Information To The United States\n\n\t\t\t\tThe RS Application is operated in the United States and is intended for users located in the United States.  If you are located anywhere outside of the United States, please be aware that information we collect, including Personal Information, will be transferred to, processed and stored in the United States.

We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children younger than the age of thirteen (13), and we will delete any Personal Information collected that we later determine to be from a user younger than the age of thirteen (13).  If you believe a child under the age of thirteen (13) has disclosed Personal Information to us, please write to us at the street address provided in the \u201cContact Us\u201d section set forth at the end of this Privacy Policy.\n\n\t\t\t\t7.\tSecurity\n\n\t\t\t\tWe have incorporated safeguards to help prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control.  However, no data transmission over the Internet, wireless transmission or electronic storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  Please note that we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit to us, and your use of the RS Application indicates that you are willing to assume this risk. \n\n\t\t\t\t8.\tChanges to the Privacy Policy\n\n\t\t\t\tWe reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice to you.  Any changes will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy.  \n\n\t\t\t\t9.\tYour California Privacy Rights: A Notice to California Users (California Civil Code Section 1798.83)\n\n\t\t\t\tCalifornia\u2019s \"Shine the Light\" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties\u2019 direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties\u2019 direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information-sharing. We have such a policy in place. \n\n\t\t\t\tOpting out of Direct Mail Marketing:\u00a0 If you do not want us to send you any offers from third parties through direct mail or share your Personal Information with other companies so that they can send you direct mail offers about their products and services, please write to us at the street address set forth at the end of this document or click here.
