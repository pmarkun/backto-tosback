CareerBuilder provides software applications (\u00e2\u0080\u009cApps\") available to the public, as well as Apps that may be purchased by companies for their employee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal use in talent management or as a company-specific social networking intranet.  Through the use of these Apps, we may collect your social network data, but will never use nor share non-public social network data that you have restricted through your social network\u00e2\u0080\u0099s privacy settings.    \r\nIf you decide to download one of our Social Media Applications, such as Work@ or NetworkEffect, we will collect your profile information, including your social network site user ID, work email address, name, city, state, social network site profile image URL, and employment history, including job titles and company names.  \r\nIf you decide to download one of our Social Media applications, such as Work@ or NetworkEffect, we will also collect information about your friends and their connections.  This includes, depending on your friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s privacy settings, names, locations, and employment histories.  \r\nThrough use of the Work@ App, the individuals with whom you have a relationship on the social networking site may provide their contact information to you or directly to CareerBuilder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customers when they request a referral or they apply for a job.

The information we may collect by automated means includes:\r\nInformation about the devices our visitors use to access the Internet (such as the IP address and the device, browser and operating system type).\r\nPages and URLs that refer visitors to our Sites, also pages and URLs that visitors exit to once they leave our Sites.\r\nDates and times of visits to our Sites.\r\nInformation on actions taken on our Sites (such as page views, site navigation patterns and job view or application activity).\r\nA general geographic location (such as country and city) from which a visitor accesses our Sites.\r\nSearch terms that visitors use to reach our Sites.\r\n(Return to Top)\r\n\r\nHow We Use the Information We Collect\r\nWe may use the information we obtain about you to:\r\nRegister, manage and maintain your account on the Sites.\r\nProvide products or services you request.\r\nProcess, validate and deliver your purchases (including by processing payment card transactions and contacting you about your orders, including by telephone).\r\nMaintain a record of the jobs you view or apply to on our Sites.  \r\nInform you of relevant job postings that may be of interest to you.\r\nProvide administrative notices or communications applicable to your use of the Sites.\r\nRespond to your questions and comments and provide customer support.\r\nContact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests (such as relevant services, educational or other career development opportunities); enable you to communicate with us through our blogs, social networks and other interactive media; and solicit your feedback and input.

We collect this information by automated means, such as cookies and web beacons, as described in more detail below.  \r\nIf we seek to use the information we obtain about you in other ways, we will provide specific notice and request your consent at the time of collection.\r\n(Return to Top)\r\n\r\nINFORMATION WE SHARE\r\nWhen you apply for a job through the Sites or publicly post your resume to our resume database, employers will have access to information about you and your potential interest in employment opportunities.  Those employers may use your information to contact you directly.  Additionally, when you apply for a job through the Sites, the information supplied by you becomes part of the CareerBuilder database but also may become part of the employer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s database.  Similarly, if your resume is downloaded by an employer, your resume may become a part of the employer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s database.  In these instances, the use of such information by the employer will be subject to the privacy policy of that company, and we are not responsible for that company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of your information.  \r\nAdditionally, we may combine certain non-personally identifiable aggregate data about our users and use such anonymous aggregate data to prepare reports for our users (typically employers or educators).  \u00e2\u0080\u009cAggregate Data\" is the demographic information (such as zip code, age, gender, race or ethnicity) and employment information (such as occupation, education and experience) of many individuals that is combined together.  Aggregate data is used to analyze the characteristics of various populations and does not identify any specific individuals.  For example, an employer may purchase a report from CareerBuilder that states the number of accountants with at least five year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s experience that live within a certain geographic area.  All such reports sold only contain aggregate data which cannot be used to identify any individuals.  \r\nWe also provide reports about activity on our Work@ App that may contain identifiable information about users who choose to download and use that App.  CareerBuilder\u00e2\u0080\u0099s customers that purchase the Work@ App will receive reports that contain the information collected through the Work@ App.  The reports may include the following: the number of installations and removals of the Work@ App, the number of referrals, shares and wall posts made by you, the number of views and the names and email addresses of individuals with whom you have a relationship when they request a referral or when they apply for a job.  CareerBuilder will not provide any other social network page content to its customers who purchase the Work@ App.  Similarly, we will not share any non-public social network page content with employers, potential employers or others through your use of NetworkEffect.  \r\nInformation and communications on company-specific CareerBuilder products, such as the intra-net social networking app WorkLife, is accessible by your employer even where sub-group membership may be limited to employees with similar interests or employment duties.  Information, communications and activities on the intra-net social networking app will also be subject to your employer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s internal policies and code of conduct in addition to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.\r\nOther than instances where users opt to publicly post their Personal Information to our resume database, provide it via a job application, include it in a job posting or otherwise provide permission to share it, we do not sell our users' Personal Information to anyone for any reason.  When posting jobs and resumes, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish to display.  All users should be aware, however, that when they choose to display or distribute Personal Information (such as their email address or other contact information on a public resume) via the Sites or any other distribution method, that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages, for which CareerBuilder is not responsible, from third parties. \r\n\r\nWhere you have provided Personal Information on a Site that is \u00e2\u0080\u0098hosted\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0098co-branded\u00e2\u0080\u0099 by another company then that information will be made available to both CareerBuilder and the hosting/co-branding company.  CareerBuilder is not responsible for what the hosting/co-branding company, or any third party with whom you may share your Personal Information, subsequently does with your information.  You should review the privacy policy of the hosting/co-branding company to ensure that you are comfortable with how it intends to use and disclose your information.  \r\nWe also may share Personal Information with our service providers who help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. These service providers may only use or disclose the information as necessary to perform services on our behalf or as otherwise required by law.\r\nCareerBuilder also may disclose specific user information when we determine, in good faith, that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement, to prevent a crime or protect national security, or to protect the interests or safety of CareerBuilder or other users of the Sites. \r\nIn addition, Personal Information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy or other corporate reorganization of CareerBuilder.  \r\n(Return to Top)\r\n\r\nResume Privacy Options\r\nPosting your resume on the Sites puts you in front of thousands of employers with open positions each day.  When you post your resume, we automatically create a registration for you using the email address and password that you supply.  When you return to the Sites in the future you will use that same email address and password to access and edit your existing resume.\r\nWe know that our job seekers have varying levels of comfort when it comes to posting their resume on the Internet.  To accommodate the needs of all users, CareerBuilder has 2 levels of resume privacy from which you can choose.  Please note that these privacy settings only apply to whether or not your resume can be viewed by third parties.  CareerBuilder will still collect, use or disclose anonymous, aggregated information about you and your visits to our website in the manner described in this Privacy Policy.\r\nStandard Posting\r\nThis option gives you the most visibility to the broadest employer audience possible by making your resume searchable in our resume database.  If you select this option, any registered employer user who purchases access to the database can view your resume and contact details (to the extent you include them in your resume).  \r\nPrivate Posting For Apply Online Only\r\nThis option allows you to post your resume on the Sites without having it searchable by or viewable to employers. The benefit is that you can quickly and easily apply for jobs without retyping your information, and you provide your resume only to those employers you are specifically interested in.\r\nWe attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database to legitimate users such as paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters and human resource professionals, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this database.  We cannot control the use of resumes by third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable database.  You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time.  However, employers, recruiters and others who have paid for access to that database, as well as parties who have otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume in their own files or databases.  We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles that have been downloaded by third parties. Accordingly, you should not put information you would not want made public in your resume.\r\n(Return to Top)\r\n\r\nAbout Cookies and Third Party Advertisers\r\nA \u00e2\u0080\u009ccookie\" is a text file that websites send to a visitor\u00e2\u0080\u0098s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s browser or to store information or settings in the browser.  A \u00e2\u0080\u009cweb beacon,\" is also called a Web bug or a pixel tag or a clear GIF. Used in combination with cookies, a Web beacon is an often-transparent graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, that is placed on a Web site or in an e-mail that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the Web site or sending the e-mail.\r\nCareerBuilder uses cookies and other similar technologies for the convenience of our users.  Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly.  CareerBuilder also uses cookies to store non-personally identifying information about you such as past jobs viewed and job searches conducted by your computer in a cookie that it places on your computer.  We do this in order to present you with job recommendations based on your interests as expressed previously through your searches.  Lastly, CareerBuilder uses cookies to ensure the proper functioning and efficiency of our Sites.  Most Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.  Please be aware, however, that some CareerBuilder features or services may not function properly without cookies.\r\nCareerBuilder permits third party cookies on its Sites.  For example, third party tools located on the Sites, including those that allow for social media sharing, may use cookies to remember user preference settings.  CareerBuilder also uses web analytics services provided by third parties, which use cookies to collect non-personal information about details of our users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 visits to the Sites (including IP addresses) and the resources they access on the Sites.  These third party web analytics services provide us with reports based on this information in order to help us understand how visitors engage with the Sites.    \r\nWe use third-party advertising companies who may place or access cookies on your computer hard drive to distinguish your web browser uniquely and to keep track of information relating to serving ads on your web browser, such as the type of ads shown and the webs pages on which the ads appeared.  These companies may use information about your visits to these Sites and to other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you on our Sites or on other, third party, sites.  We also may give third party advertisers the ability to tailor their advertisements on our Sites using demographic and preference information we provide to them in aggregate form.  This information does not identify you individually.  \r\nThese companies operate under their own privacy policies and CareerBuilder encourages you to be aware of the privacy policies of such companies.  CareerBuilder does not have control over or access to any information contained in the cookies that are set on your computer by third party advertisers.  \r\nTo help prevent and limit the automatic collection of information by any participating third party advertisers, you may opt-out of such collection by clicking the Ad Choices icon located within the ad, by accessing the \u00e2\u0080\u009cabout ads\" opt-out site, or by accessing the NAI opt-out site.  Please note that this opt-out is cookie-based.  If you buy a new computer, change web browsers or delete this cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out task again.  To obtain instructions regarding deleting or disabling cookies from third party advertising companies that are not members of the About Ads or NAI self-regulatory behavioral ad opt-out groups, please click here.\r\nIn addition, some of the employers that use our Sites may place cookies on your computer through their job postings and may use such cookies to distinguish your web browser uniquely.  Often, employers use such information to track the effectiveness of their job postings by measuring how many users who view their postings later became job applicants.  To obtain guidance regarding deleting or disabling cookies, please click here.\r\n(Return to Top)\r\n\r\nUpdate Your Account Information\r\nYou may access, update and amend Personal Information included in your online account at any time by logging into your account and making the necessary changes.  You may also delete your resume from our resume database at any time by logging in to your account and deleting the resume.  Deleting your resume will remove it from your account and from the resume database, however; if you have applied to a job in the past, that particular employer will still be able to access your resume.  Further, you will not be able to delete data held by third parties, such as prospective employers, that have already accessed and downloaded your information or resume.\r\n(Return to Top)\r\n\r\nLinks to Other Websites\r\nOur Sites may contain links to other sites for your convenience and information.  These sites may be operated by companies not owned by CareerBuilder.  In addition, if you are using our App through a social networking site, remember that our Apps may be served by or hosted by other sites. These other sites or linked third-party sites may have their own privacy notices, which you should review if you visit those sites.  We are not responsible for the content of any sites not owned by CareerBuilder, any use of those sites, or those sites\u00e2\u0080\u0099 privacy practices.\r\n(Return to Top)\r\n\r\nInternational Data Transfers\r\nWhen we obtain Personal Information about you, we may process and store the information outside of the country in which you are located, including in the United States.  The countries in which we process the information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you are located. Further, users who access your information, such as potential employers, also may be located in a different country than you and different laws may apply to their use of your information.  \r\nCareerBuilder, LLC complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.

We use BluePay Processing LLC to process credit card purchases and their privacy policy may be viewed here.  \r\n(Return to Top)\r\n\r\nCalifornia, USA Residents\r\nCalifornia law permits its residents to request and receive information about a business\u00e2\u0080\u0099 disclosure of certain categories of Personal Information to other companies for their use in direct marketing.
