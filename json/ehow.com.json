This Privacy Policy (the \u00e2\u0080\u009cPolicy\u00e2\u0080\u009d) discusses the personally identifying information (\u00e2\u0080\u009cPII\u00e2\u0080\u009d) that we collect about you through eHow's website, which includes all of the eHow.com articles and videos and other services we provide on the website  (collectively, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSite\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Please read the complete Policy below and contact us if you have any questions. This Policy is part of and incorporated into the Terms of Use of the Site.\n\n If you are not comfortable with this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Use, please do not provide us with PII or other information or content or otherwise use the Site.\n\nWhat information may be collected by eHow, and how is it collected? \n\t\tType of Information We Collect. We use Facebook Login so you can use your existing Facebook.com account to access the features of the Site.  You must explicitly authorize Facebook to share your information with us when you first login to the Site with your Facebook credentials.\n\t\tYou should review your privacy settings on your Facebook account because those settings determine and govern what PII may be made available to us when you access the Site.  While Facebook Login allows us to access a variety of information about you based on your Facebook account\u00e2\u0080\u0099s privacy settings, we only access PII which we feel is useful to enhance your experience of the Site, including your name, gender and location.  We may also collect any information you enter on the Site or give us in any other way (such as through an email, survey, or letter). If you formerly maintained a user profile on the Site through a predecessor user registration form, that user profile will no longer be accessible except for users who participated in the Writer Compensation Program (\"WCP\").  See Section 6 of the Terms of Use for more information about the WCP.\n\n\t\tInformation in Public Areas of the Site. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily provide information in public areas of the Site, that information can be viewed and possibly used by others. We therefore advise users not to disclose contact information, including phone number, email address, street address or instant messenger address (within these public areas) that they do not wish to share. We are not responsible for PII you choose to submit in these public areas.\n\n\t\tCookies. Like many websites, we use \"cookies.\" Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your information and to link your activities to you. While you can take steps to warn off, block or disable cookies, if you do, the Site may not function and appear as we have designed it. Nonetheless, if you want to take these steps, you can do so by following the instructions associated with your browser. For more information about cookies, including controlling and deleting them, please visit the www.aboutcookies.org website.\n\n Our cookies do not collect PII that you provide to us during the registration process, but\n\tthey do collect other information such as the following:\nthe domain name and host from which you access the Internet and the Internet address of\n\t\tthe site from which you direct-linked to ours;\n\t\n\tthe date and time you access the Site and pages you visit;\n\tyour computer's IP address and information about its operating system, platform and the\n\t\tWeb browser type and version you use;\n\t\n\tdemographic and other non-personally identifiable profile information about you; and\n\t\n\tinformation to combat fraud or misuse.\nPixel Tags. In our emails to you, we may use \"pixel tags\" to determine if\n\tyour email software or service can display html-formatted email (this helps us optimize the\n\tsize of our email messages and conserve bandwidth).\n\nCollection of Information by Third Parties. Our Site may include third-party\n\tadvertising, links to other websites, and other content from third party businesses. The\n\tcontent posted by these parties will be reasonably identifiable as coming from a third\n\tparty. We do not provide any PII to these advertisers, third-party websites, or other\n\tbusinesses, although on occasion we may mutually share non-personally identifiable (e.g.\n\tdemographic) information to facilitate delivery of relevant advertisements. These\n\tthird-party websites, businesses, and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their\n\tbehalf, sometimes use technology to deliver (or \"serve\") the advertisements that appear on\n\tour Site directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this\n\thappens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or\n\tsingle-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to\n\tpersonalize or optimize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over\n\tcookies or other technologies that they may use, and the information practices of these\n\tadvertisers and third-party websites or businesses are not covered by this Policy but are\n\tcovered by their respective privacy policies. Some, but not all, third party advertising\n\tcompanies provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology.\n\nPromotions, Sweepstakes, and Contests. From time to time, we may host a\n\tpromotion, sweepstake, or contest on the Site. You may be asked to provide PII or permit the\n\ttransfer to a third party of your PII in connection with such promotion, sweepstake or\n\tcontest.
