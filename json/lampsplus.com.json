(\u201cLAMPS PLUS\u201d or \u201cwe\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) has created this privacy policy (this \"Privacy Policy\") in order to demonstrate its commitment to user, visitor, subscriber, and customer privacy with regard to the Lamps Plus web site located at  lampsplus.com (the \u201cWebsite\u201d). Privacy on the Website is of great importance to us. Because we gather important information from our users, visitors and customers (collectively \u201cSubscribers\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour\u201d), we have established this Privacy Policy as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices. By accessing the Website, you acknowledge and agree to this Privacy Policy and also agree to the Terms of Use of the Website located here.\r\nYou can visit most of the pages on LAMPS PLUS without ever telling us who you are, as we do not ask users to register or establish an account with us in order to browse our site. We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and look at this data for user trends and statistics, but individual site visitors remain anonymous, unless, at some point, you tell us who you are. \r\nHowever, when you use our online services like joining LAMPS PLUS Rewards or our e-mail list, saving viewed products in an online Wish List, leaving a product review, entering a sweepstakes, or purchasing a product from us online, you agree to tell us something about yourself. \r\nWhen you join LAMPS PLUS Rewards or our e-mail list, enter a sweepstakes, or use online services such as our Wish List, you are asked for your e-mail address, name and zip code. You may also be asked for a street address and other information. When placing an order on our site, we ask you for contact information like name and shipping address, and payment information like credit card number, expiration date, and customer card identification number. Without providing information like this you will be unable to order products on our site or use certain online services. \r\nWe use the personal information that you provide about yourself for a number of internal purposes, such as confirming your order and maintaining a record of your online product purchases. We also use your personal information to provide you with certain benefits if you enroll in our LAMPS PLUS Rewards program, and to send you catalogs and information about special promotions. In addition, we may use your personal information to contact you if we have trouble processing your order. \r\nWe also may combine the information you give us online, in our stores, or through our catalogs, including personal information about you and your order. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your online shopping experience with us, to communicate with you both on and offline about our products and events that may be of interest to you. \r\nWe do not sell, share or rent e-mail addresses to any third parties. Furthermore, we do not share the credit card information you provide to us with anyone other than your credit card provider. However, other information about you may be combined with publicly available information, as well as information we receive from reputable companies we have selected to analyze the data we collect. \r\nWe do reserve the right to disclose your personal information when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities that may be causing injury to you, LAMPS PLUS, or to others. We may also disclose personal information when we believe the law requires it.\r\nMarketing Partnerships\r\nWe maintain relationships with select business partners whom we have deemed to be trustworthy and responsible and whose privacy policies are aligned with ours. We may share or cross-reference data, including personal information (name, street address and transactional information), about you and your order with our business partners, allowing them to contact you regarding products and/or services that may be of interest to you. We may also share your personal information with any of our subsidiaries, including our flash sales website. \r\nIn addition, when we join with another company to offer or provide services, products, sweepstakes, contests, or promotions, we and the other company may cross-reference our customer databases to identify common customers. We and the other company may use that existing information to identify future promotional opportunities and to fulfill promotional or contractual obligations.\r\nIf you prefer that we do not share your name and address with other marketers, please email us at customerservice@LampsPlus.com. \r\nYour California Privacy Rights\r\n\r\nLAMPS PLUS complies with Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code \u2013 the \u2018Shine the Light Law\u2019.\r\n\r\nUnder Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California that have an established business relationship with LAMPS PLUS and that have provided certain personal information to LAMPS PLUS (\u201cCalifornia Consumer\u201d) have the right to request certain information from LAMPS PLUS.  California Consumers may request that LAMPS PLUS disclose (i) the types of personal information shared with third parties for those third parties\u2019 direct marketing purposes, if any and (ii) the identity of any such third party with whom LAMPS PLUS has shared personal information, if any, during the previous calendar year. \r\nCalifornia Consumers may make one such request each year. \r\nTo submit a request for information please email LAMPS PLUS at customerservice@LampsPlus.com.  Please include \"Request for California Privacy Information\" in the subject line and in the body of your e-mail.  LAMPS PLUS will respond with the requested information, if any, to the email.\r\nContests and Promotions\r\nWhen we offer contests and promotions, or join with other companies to do so, customers who choose to participate in those contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information to participate. That information may then be used by us and any company offering the contest or promotion to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations. \r\nProduct and Store Reviews\r\nWhen you leave a product review on our site, the information you provide about yourself, including your e-mail address, is collected for us by a third party vendor. Customer comments are reviewed both by our third party vendor and by LAMPS PLUS. Any personal information collected in the product review process, including e-mail addresses, is covered by our LAMPS PLUS privacy policy as outlined here and by our Terms of Use policy. Reviews are posted on LampsPlus.com at our discretion. When a product review is submitted on this web site, you grant LAMPS PLUS and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the world in any media. \r\nWhen you leave a store review on our site, the review may be posted on LampsPlus.com or shared on social media sites at our discretion. You grant LAMPS PLUS and its affiliates a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the world in any media. \r\nThis policy covers information collected on visitors to the LampsPlus.com site through the process of ordering products, joining our e-mail lists, submitting product reviews and using our online services, as well as information collected through LAMPS PLUS retail stores. \r\n\r\nPrivacy and E-Mail Referrals\r\nThe above rules and code of conduct applies to e-mails that you provide us in the course of using one of our \"e-mail to a friend\" utilities or \"refer a friend\" promotions. We will send the requested information to the specified third party, who then has the option of not receiving further communications from us.\r\nback to top | main help\r\n\r\nSecurity\r\nAt LAMPS PLUS, we understand your concerns about security and privacy. We protect the sensitive information you give us, such as credit card numbers, by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the information you share with us. This process makes it statistically much safer to shop with us than to use your card in a restaurant or store. This encryption applies to users viewing our site using up-to-date, modern browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari or Chrome.  \r\nback to top | main help\r\n\r\nFraudulent Charge Protection\r\nLAMPS PLUS offers a \"Safe Shopping Guarantee.\" If a third party obtains your personal information from a purchase made with LAMPS PLUS and uses that information to perpetrate credit card fraud, you are protected. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank may hold you liable for up to $50 of fraudulent charges. If your bank holds you liable for any portion of the $50, LAMPS PLUS will cover up to the entire $50. \r\nLAMPS PLUS will cover this liability if the unauthorized use resulted through no fault of yours from a purchase made on the LAMPS PLUS secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card company in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.\r\nback to top | main help\r\n\r\nCookies\r\nLike many other online retailers, LAMPS PLUS uses a technology called \"cookies\". A cookie is a small bit of data that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive that we use to help us retrieve data you may have stored with us. For example, in our  \"Wish List\" section, we use cookies to help us retrieve the lighting products that you have saved in these areas. The \"Help\" portion on the toolbar of most browsers will tell you how to delete your computer's cookies or how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of the LAMPS PLUS website, and we recommend that you leave the feature turned on. \r\nLAMPS PLUS may occasionally use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous and is not relatable to you. These third parties are prohibited by our contract with them from sharing that information with anyone other than us or our advertising service providers. However, LAMPS PLUS respects your privacy and your right to choose whether to be included in such services. If you would like more information or would like to learn about your ability to unsubscribe of this type of practice, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking here. If you choose to unsubscribe , an \"unsubscribe  cookie\" will be placed on your computer. If the cookie is removed or deleted, if you upgrade your browser or if you visit us from a different computer, you will need to return to the link above to re-select your preferences.\r\nback to top | main help\r\n\r\nUnsubscribing From Our E-mail List\r\nIf you've joined our e-mail list, you may unsubscribe  of it at any time.

Unsubscribe  instructions are also included with each LAMPS PLUS e-mail. \r\nIf you choose to unsubscribe from one of our e-mail Lists, CAN-SPAM legislation stipulates that your address be removed within 10 business days. In most cases, Lamps Plus will remove your address within 5 business days, and you will receive no further mailings from us. \r\nPlease note that should you order from us in the future, you will receive order and shipping confirmations via e-mail.\r\nIf you choose to remove your e-mail address from our mailing list, LAMPS PLUS, in compliance with the CAN-SPAM legislation, may occasionally supply a list of removed e-mail addresses to our advertising partners. This is done to ensure that those e-mail addresses do not receive new advertising offers from us through our advertising partners.  \r\nback to top | main help\r\n\r\nUnsubscribing From Our Catalog Mailing List\r\nIf you purchase something from us, we may occasionally send you a printed catalog through the mail. If you prefer not to receive our catalog, cancel at any time by e-mailing us at catalogservice@LampsPlus.com with \"remove\" as the subject line and your name and address in the body of the message, or you may call 1-800-782-1967. Your name will be removed from our mailing list within two weeks of your request. Due to the nature of catalog mailing preparation, however, you may receive mailed catalogs up to 90 days after your request.  \r\nback to top | main help\r\nUnsubscribing From Marketing Partnerships \r\nIf you prefer that we do not share your name and address with other marketers, please email us at customerservice@LampsPlus.com. \r\nback to top | main help\r\n\r\nProtecting Children\r\nWe take special care to protect the safety and privacy of children.
