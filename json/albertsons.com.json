We employ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, a commonly employed method of encrypted communication used on the Internet, to encrypt during transmission, sensitive personal information you input, including credit card numbers. However, because no data security systems are completely secure, we do not warrant that any personal information that you provide to us will be secure or safe from unauthorized access. If you provide any personal information to us, you do so at your own risk.\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\tLINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tOur website may contain links to websites operated by third parties.
