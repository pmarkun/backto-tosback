Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, females over 25 years old). We take the advertisement and display it to users meeting those criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to you washingtonpost.com account.Washingtonpost.com also does research on our users\u2019 demographics, interests and behavior based on the information you provide to us including upon registration, on order forms, during a promotion, as well as from our server log files or from surveys.

A cookie can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a Web site; we may also use the information for editorial purposes and for other purposes such as measuring certain traffic patterns.

You can opt out of DoubleClick\u2019s use of cookies for these purposes by visiting http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/.In some cases, we and advertisers on washingtonpost.com and other sites work with other third-party vendors to help deliver advertisements tailored to your interests.

If we need to change our policy in the future, we will post these changes as soon as they go into effect.\u00a9 Copyright 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2010 WP Company LLC d/b/a The Washington Post***Related: Terms of Service and Discussion and Submission Guidelines\n\n",
