When you make a qualifying purchase at any of the websites designated as participating sites  by\n            Wayfair from time to time (the \"Participating Sites\"), you will have the opportunity\n            to earn Wayfair \"Rewards Dollars\" equal to three percent (3%) of the net amount\n            paid for that qualifying purchase, which Rewards Dollars may only be applied to future purchases at the Participating Sites in\n            accordance with these Terms of Use.\n          \n\n          \n            Enrollment and Eligibility. To enroll in the Wayfair            rewards program (the \"Rewards Program\"), you must register at the Rewards Program landing page which can be accessed by clicking\n            the following link: https://www.wayfair.com/asp/secure/session/account/rewards_info.asp .  There are no fees or charges\n            to enroll in the Rewards Program.  Only individuals are eligible to enroll, each Member may have only one account and use only one\n            email address. Accounts may not be combined.  Membership is limited to legal residents of the fifty (50) United States and the\n            District of Columbia and Canada (excluding Quebec) who are 18 years of age or older, or the age of majority in their state,\n            province or territory of residence, whichever is older, at the time they register for the Rewards Program.  Corporations,\n            groups, or other associated entities are not eligible to participate in the Rewards Program.  Employees of\n            Wayfair and SK Retail, Inc. are not eligible to participate in the Rewards Program.\n            Persons who are eligible for and have properly registered for the Rewards Program shall be referred to hereinafter as \"Member(s).\"\n          \n\n          \n            Collect Rewards Dollars. A Member can collect Rewards Dollars when he or she purchases and pays in full\n            for products ordered online at one of the Participating Sites (the \"Transaction\").  Rewards Dollars will be issued in an amount equal\n            to three percent (3%) of the net amount paid for the Transaction, regardless of method of payment.  If the net amount paid for the\n            original Transaction changes for any reason, whether due to a subsequent change in products purchased or otherwise, any associated\n            Reward Dollars will be adjusted to reflect the modified net amount paid for the Transaction.  Rewards Dollars will be credited to a\n            Member's account within ten (10) days of the closing of each qualifying Transaction.  All dollar amounts are rounded down.  Rewards\n            Dollars are earned on the net US dollar amount paid on the Transaction, and will be in the form of a credit in US currency that can\n            be applied to another future Transaction.  The \"net amount\" shall mean the cash amount paid by the Member for the product(s)\n            purchased in connection with the Transaction, excluding any payment of applicable taxes, and shipping and handling charges and after\n            applying any discounts or other credits.   Rewards Dollars are not earned on any discounted dollar amounts, applicable taxes,\n            shipping and handling charges, returns, credits, purchases of gift cards and/or gift certificates, or purchases in whole or in part\n            with Rewards Dollars.  No Rewards Dollars will be earned for any activities prior to enrollment.  Rewards Dollars are not valid for\n            cash or cash equivalents.\n          \n\n          \n            Redemption of Rewards Dollars. Rewards Dollars can be only redeemed and applied as a credit against the\n            purchase price of a Transaction.  In order to redeem Rewards Dollars, you must either enter the promotional code assigned to you for\n            such redemption when you confirm the Transaction or, if available, check the applicable box during the checkout process on any\n            Participating Sites.  Rewards Dollars are not redeemable for cash or cash equivalent and may not be applied toward payment of any\n            outstanding Wayfair account balances or previous purchases.  Rewards Dollars may not\n            be combined with other Wayfair promotions, offers, or other discounts.  Except in the\n            case of valid returns as specified below, no credits or refunds will be issued for any reason after Rewards Dollars have been redeemed,\n            including for unused Rewards Dollars.\n          \n\n          \n            Returns. If you return an item that was purchased in whole or in part using Rewards Dollars, such return\n            will be processed in accordance with Wayfair's return and exchange policy and if the\n            return is accepted by Wayfair, the Rewards Dollars applicable to the returned item will\n            be credited back to your account.\n          \n\n          \n            Non-Transferability and Non-Aggregation of Rewards Dollars. Rewards Dollars and any other right,\n            obligation or benefit of the Rewards Program may not be transferred, assigned, sold, traded or bartered by any Member or any other\n            person, without Wayfair's prior written consent, which\n            Wayfair may withhold in its sole discretion, and any attempt to do any of the foregoing\n            shall be null and void. In addition, Rewards Dollars are for the Member's personal use only.  Members may not aggregate Rewards\n            Dollars from multiple accounts or use Rewards Dollars for the purpose of purchasing products from the Participating Sites on behalf\n            of others or for the purpose of reselling such products to others.\n          \n\n          \n            Check Your Rewards Dollars.
