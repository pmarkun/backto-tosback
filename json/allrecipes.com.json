(\u201cAllrecipes.com\u201d), we recognize the importance of your \r\n    privacy. That said, it\u2019s understandable that you may be concerned with the information you provide \r\n    to us or that is collected by us and how we use and disclose it. With these concerns in mind, we\u2019ve \r\n    developed the Allrecipes.com Privacy Policy, outlined below. This Privacy Policy explains Allrecipes\u2019 \r\n    privacy practices for visitors to our Web site at Allrecipes (the \u201cWeb site\u201d). By using our Web site, \r\n    you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this \r\n    Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the Allrecipes \r\n    Terms and Conditions. We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any \r\n    material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will post a new policy on the Web site and update the \r\n    \u201clast updated\u201d date set forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check our Privacy Policy whenever \r\n    you visit the Web site to see if it has been updated since your last visit.

Personal information also includes \r\n    demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area, and preferences, when such \r\n    information is linked to other personal information that identifies the individual.\r\n    \r\n    Aggregate Information:  Personal information does not include \u201caggregate\u201d \r\n    information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of products, \r\n    services or customers, from which individual customer identities have been removed. In other words, \r\n    information about how you use a service might be collected and combined with information about how \r\n    others use the same service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. \r\n    Likewise, information about the products you purchase might be collected and combined with \r\n    information about the products purchased by others. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and \r\n    customer needs so that we can better consider new products and services, and tailor existing \r\n    products and services to customer desires. We might share aggregate information about our users \r\n    with third parties for various purposes, such as helping us better understand and improve our \r\n    services, and for advertising and marketing purposes. \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    TOP\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    How We Collect and Use Personal Information\r\n    Allrecipes.com collects personal information from you at several different points on our Web site, \r\n    as set forth below. In general, we use personal information for the purpose for which it was collected \r\n    (such as to provide services or complete transactions you have requested, for billing purposes, and to \r\n    anticipate and resolve problems with our Web site and our products and services), for our own internal \r\n    business operations, to respond to customer support inquiries and for other purposes as described \r\n    below.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    TOP\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Registration, Purchases; Other Information Submissions\r\n    When you register to become a member on our Web site, you are asked to create a unique login \r\n    and password, and are required to give certain personal information (such as your name, email \r\n    address, and zip code). We might also request certain information about your tastes and preferences \r\n    (such as your favorite food, purchases or recipes). \r\n    \r\n    Information you provide during registration might be used for some or all of the following: \r\n    \r\n        to provide services you have requested, or to otherwise fulfill your request; and \r\n        to contact you from time to time (i) about services on our Web site for which you have \r\n        expressed interest; (ii) with news, (iii) for internal marketing, informational, and promotional \r\n        purposes; or (iv) for any other lawful purpose related to your use of the Web site. \r\n        Additionally, your registration information might be used, together with other information you \r\n    submit to us in conjunction with your use of the Web site, for the following purposes: \r\n\r\n        for editorial purposes, such as when you submit a recipe to us (e.g., to attribute your submitted recipe to you); \r\n        to contact you for any reason regarding content you have submitted to the Web site (e.g., to ask you a question about a recipe you have submitted); and\r\n        to identify you by name when posting content you submit to us on the Web site (e.g., when you request a recipe on the Web site, to post your name and a description of the recipe you are requesting). \r\n        If, during or immediately following registration, you choose to view offers for goods and \r\n    services that are available from selected third party companies (\u201cCo-Registration Vendors\u201d), we will \r\n    make certain contact and demographic information you provide during registration (e.g., name, age, \r\n    and/or e-mail address) available to these vendors. If you request goods or services from a \r\n    Co-Registration Vendor, you might be asked to submit additional demographic and other personal \r\n    information. The Co-Registration Vendor might use your registration information which we provide \r\n    to it, along with any information you submit directly to it, to fulfill, or secure fulfillment of, \r\n    your request. For additional information about disclosure of your personal information to our \r\n    Co-Registration Vendors, and their use thereafter, please see the \u201cDisclosure of Personal \r\n    Information\u201d section below.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    We collect personal information such as your credit card, credit card billing address, and \r\n    related billing information if you purchase products or services on our Web site. We use this \r\n    information to fulfill your orders and bill you for them. \r\n    \r\n    Any information that is not personally identifiable information but is publicly displayed on the \r\n    Web site (such as user name and photos) might appear in the results of searches conducted on \r\n    Internet search engines while you are a member of the Web site and potentially for some time period \r\n    after your membership is terminated, depending upon the search engine\u2019s indexing practices. \r\n    Communication\r\n    As an Allrecipes member, you will receive our transactional business communications (e.g. membership communications, administrative messages, etc.) \r\n    at your email address or street address. In addition you might be automatically enrolled in one or more of our email subscription programs. While \r\n    we reserve the right to send you our transactional business communications without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them, we do \r\n    provide you with the opportunity to select whether or not you wish to continue to receive our subscription-based emails.  See the Email and Newsletters \r\n    section below for information on how to manage your subscriptions. \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    TOP\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Email and Newsletters\r\n    When you submit your email address to us to initiate a subscription to one of our newsletters we \r\n    ask for personal information such as your name and email address. This personal information is only \r\n    used to send you the newsletter(s) you are opted in to receive. You may choose not to receive promotional \r\n    emails or electronic newsletters from us by: (A) following the \"unsubscribe\" instructions in the specific \r\n    email from which you wish to opt-out; (B) visiting the \r\n    Manage My Email Subscriptions \r\n    section of the Site and following the appropriate \r\n    instructions or (C) contacting Customer Service and specifying the\r\n    particular email(s) from which you wish to be removed.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    TOP\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    E-mail-A-Friend\r\n    When you elect to use our referral service for e-mailing a recipe or other content to a friend, \r\n    we ask you for your friend\u2019s name and e-mail address. Allrecipes will automatically send your friend \r\n    a one-time e-mail on your behalf which contains the recipe or other content, and which invites your \r\n    friend to visit the Web site. Allrecipes uses your friend\u2019s name and e-mail address only to send \r\n    this one-time e-mail, and does not store this information. If your friend does not wish to \r\n    receive \u201ce-mail-a-friend\u201d messages to be sent on your behalf, he or she must contact you directly. \r\n    Allrecipes users may not use our referral service to send unwanted spam to others.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    TOP\r\n    \r\n\r\n \r\n    \r\n    Invite-A-Friend\r\n    \r\n    When You Use \u201cInvite-A-Friend\u201d or other referral services \r\n    \r\n    If you elect to use any of our referral services for informing a friend about our Site or any portion \r\n    thereof, you will be asked to provide your friend\u2019s name and e-mail address. We will then \r\n    automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail (usually including your name and email address) \r\n    inviting them to visit the Site. We ask for this information for the sole purpose of sending this \r\n    one-time e-mail and tracking the success of our referral program.\r\n    \r\n    Public Forums\r\n    \r\n    We may offer chat rooms, message boards, bulletin boards, blogs or similar public forums where you \r\n    and other users of our Website can communicate. The protections described in this Privacy Policy \r\n    do not apply when you provide information (including personal information) in connection with your \r\n    use of these public forums. We may use personally identifiable and non-personal information about \r\n    you to identify you with a posting in a public forum. Any information you share in a public forum \r\n    is public information and may be seen or collected by anyone, including third parties that do not \r\n    adhere to our Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for events arising from the distribution of \r\n    any information you choose to publicly post or share through our Website.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n    TOP\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Contests, Promotions, Offers, and Surveys\r\n    From time to time our Web site requests personal information from users via contests, promotions, \r\n    offers and surveys. Participation in these contests, promotions, offers, and surveys is completely \r\n    voluntary and you therefore may choose whether to disclose personal information in connection with \r\n    these activities. Personal Information requested in these activities might include contact \r\n    information (e.g., your name and shipping address) and demographic information (e.g., your zip code \r\n    or age level). We use this information to notify you if you\u2019ve won and to award prizes. We use \r\n    information we collect in surveys for internal purposes, such as to ascertain the use of this Web \r\n    site and improve its usefulness to you. We might also provide third parties with this information, \r\n    and might combine it with some or all of your registration information. Third parties might use \r\n    the information we provide them to contact you regarding products or services of interest to you. \r\n    These disclosures are discussed in greater detail below in the \r\n    \u201cDisclosure of Personal Information\u201d section.
