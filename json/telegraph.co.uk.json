Third party advertising cookies \n\n\n6.1 Most of the advertisements you see on the website are generated by third \n  parties. \n\n\nSome of these third parties generate their own cookies (or web beacons) to \n  track how many people have seen a particular advertisement (or use the \n  services of third parties to do this), and to track how many people have \n  seen it more than once. These cookies cannot be used to identify an \n  individual; they can only be used for statistical purposes, for example, in \n  providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. \n  Some of the information gleaned from third party cookies will be aggregated \n  with other anonymous information for statistical purposes. The third party \n  companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy \n  policies but we don't have access to these cookies; other than allowing them \n  to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we \n  may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and \n  provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements \n  to users of the website). \n\n\n6.2 If you would like to disable \"third party\" cookies generated by \n  advertisers or providers of targeted advertising services, you can turn them \n  off by going to the third party's website and getting them to generate a \n  one-time \"no thanks\" cookie that will stop any further cookies being written \n  to your machine. Here are links to the two main third party advertising \n  platforms we use, each of which haveinstructions on how to do this: \n\n\nhttp://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/ad-cookie/ \n\n\nhttp://www.audiencescience.com/privacy \n\n\n6.3 You can also visit the trade body representing these advertising companies \n  for more information on how to opt out of these cookies: \n  http://youronlinechoices.com/ \n\n\n7. Security \n\n\n7.1 The password you provide when registering with the website is encrypted to \n  ensure protection against unauthorised access to your personal information. \n\n\n7.2 We invest in high-quality security and do our utmost to protect user \n  privacy. No data transmission over the Internet can be entirely secure, and \n  therefore we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information \n  and/or use of the website. Any information that you send is at your own risk \n  and may be read by others. However once we have received your personal \n  information we use strict procedures to protect the security of your \n  personal information. \n\n\n8. Disclosing your information \n\n\n8.1 We may disclose your personal information if we are approached by a \n  potential buyer of our business, if we required to do so by law or in \n  good-faith believing such action is necessary to comply with the law. \n\n\n8.2 We sometimes share your personal information with third parties who are \n  our subcontractors or providers of various products and services on our \n  behalf e.g. the providers of the services available on our \u201cOffers\u201d page: \n  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/offers/. \n\n\n8.3 We never sell personal information, or pass it to third parties for \n  marketing purposes without your permission. \n\n\n9. Where we store your personal information \n\n\n9.1 The personal information that we collect from you may be sent and stored \n  outside the European Economic Area (\"EEA\") in order to carry out the \n  activities listed in \u201cUse of Your Information\u201d. \n\n\n10.

If you don't feel we're adhering to this Policy, what should you do? \n\n\n11.1 If you believe that we have not adhered to this Policy, please notify us \n  by email at data.protection@telegraph.co.uk and we will try to solve the \n  problem promptly. \n\n\nThis Policy was last updated on January 10, 2013.\n\n\n\r\n",
