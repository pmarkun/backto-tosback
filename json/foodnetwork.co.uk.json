[]Whether or not you provide this personally identifiable information\r\n                    is your choice; however, in many instances this type of information is required\r\n                    to participate in the particular activity, realize a benefit we may offer, or\r\n                    gain access to certain content on our Website. \r\n                    \r\n                    (2)Non-Personal Information: \r\n                    \r\n                    Non-personal information is any information that does not personally identify you. \r\n                    Non-personal information can include certain personally identifiable\r\n                    information that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been\r\n                    rendered anonymous.

HOW WE USE & SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED \r\n \r\n                    \r\n                    (1)Personally Identifiable Information: \r\n                    \r\n                    The personally identifiable information you submit to us is generally used to carry out your\r\n                    requests, respond to your inquiries, better serve you, or in other ways\r\n                    naturally associated with the circumstances in which you provided the\r\n                    information.  We may also use this information to later contact you for a\r\n                    variety of reasons, such as customer service, providing you promotional\r\n                    information for our products or those of our parent company, subsidiaries or\r\n                    other affiliated companies (\u201caffiliated companies\u201d), or to communicate with you\r\n                    about content or other information you have posted or shared with us via our\r\n                    Website.  You may opt-out from receiving future promotional information from us\r\n                    or our affiliated companies, or direct that we not share your information with\r\n                    any affiliated companies, as set forth below. \r\n                    \r\n                    In certain instances we may also share your personally identifiable information with our third party\r\n                    vendors performing functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our affiliated\r\n                    companies) e.g., vendors that process credit card orders, deliver our\r\n                    merchandise, administer our promotions, provide us marketing or promotional\r\n                    assistance, analyze our data, assist us with customer service, etc.  Our\r\n                    vendors agree to use this information, and we share information with them, only\r\n                    to carry out our requests. \r\n                    \r\n                    In addition, we may share your personally identifiable information with participating sponsors to a\r\n                    program or promotion (e.g., a competition or contest) you enter via our\r\n                    Website, and with third parties who assist us in using the content or other\r\n                    information you have posted or shared with us via our Website (e.g., production\r\n                    companies we may use).  Further, we may share your personally identifiable\r\n                    information with third parties such as our co-promotional partners and others\r\n                    with whom we have marketing or other relationships.\r\n                    \r\n                    Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or as set forth when you submit the\r\n                    information, your personally identifiable information will not be shared or\r\n                    sold to any third parties without your prior approval.  \r\n \r\n                    \r\n                    (2)Non-Personal Information: \r\n                    \r\n                    We use non-personal information in a variety of ways, including to help analyze site traffic,\r\n                    understand customer needs and trends, carry out targeted promotional\r\n                    activities, and to improve our services.  We may use your non-personal\r\n                    information by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from\r\n                    others.  We may share your non-personal information with our affiliated\r\n                    companies and third parties to achieve these objectives and others, but\r\n                    remember that aggregate information is anonymous information that does not\r\n                    personally identify you.\r\n                    \r\n                    C. OTHER USES & INFORMATION \r\n                    \r\n                    (1)IP Addresses: \r\n \r\n                    \r\n                    An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing\r\n                    the Internet.  Web servers (computers that \u201cserve up\u201d web pages) automatically\r\n                    identify your computer by its IP address.  When visitors request pages from our\r\n                    Website, our servers typically log their IP addresses.  We collect IP addresses\r\n                    for purposes of system administration, to report non-personal aggregate\r\n                    information to others, and to track the use of our Website.  IP addresses are\r\n                    considered non-personal information (except where used to identify individuals)\r\n                    and may also be shared as provided above.  It is not our practice to link IP\r\n                    addresses to anything personally identifiable; that is, the visitor's session\r\n                    will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous to us.  However, we reserve\r\n                    the right to use IP addresses to identify a visitor when we feel it is\r\n                    necessary to enforce compliance with our Website rules or to:  (a) fulfill a\r\n                    government request; (b) conform with the requirements of the law or legal\r\n                    process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights or property, our Website, or\r\n                    other users; or (d) in an emergency to protect the health and safety of our\r\n                    Website's users or the general public.\r\n                    \r\n                    (2)Cookies, etc.: \r\n                    \r\nWe may use cookies and other similar technologies to ensure you get the best from our Website. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCookies\u00e2\u0080\u009d are small text files from a website that are stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device.
