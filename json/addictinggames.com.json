CONTACT US\n\tI.INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE.\n  We may request or\n  collect certain information when you visit the Nickelodeon Sites. However, visitors are\n  required to share only the information that is reasonably necessary to participate in\n  the particular activity.\n\n   A.\u00a0\n  Registration Information:\u00a0 The information required to register varies by\n  Site, but may include: (a) birth date; (b) gender; (c) country; (d) state; (e) zip\n  code; (f) user name and password; (g) wireless telephone number; (h) email address; and\n  (i) other profile information such as avatar preferences, communications preferences,\n  and interests. If the Site either is directed to children under 13 or has actual\n  knowledge that a user is under 13 years old, the child is asked to provide his or her\n  parent's or guardian's email address. For certain countries, visitors or their parents\n  will receive an activation email and must follow the procedures or otherwise agree to\n  the terms within the activation email within a certain time period to activate the\n  account; accounts not activated within that time period will be deleted.\u00a0\n  Registration information\n  is used to enable visitors to take advantage of site offerings; respond to\n  visitor\u2019s requests for products, services, and information; manage games; serve\n  appropriate material; customize the content you see when you visit the Nickelodeon\n  Sites; and offer visitors special offers and promotions from Nickelodeon Sites and the\n  \u201cViacom family of companies\u201d (which comprises Viacom International Inc. and\n  its subsidiaries and affiliates), as well as on behalf of selected third parties\n  offering products, programs or services, that we believe may be of interest to you.\n\n  B. Social Platform\n  Registrations and Social Media Plugins: Some of the Nickelodeon Sites permit or\n  require you to register or log into your account via a social networking platform such\n  as Facebook Connect or Flux, or permit you to use social media plugins such as the\n  Facebook \u201cLike\u201d or Google \u201c+1\u201d buttons. When you use these\n  social networking platforms and plugins, your username and password for the services\n  and other information available about you or collected from you on these services may\n  be shared with us.\n  When you use social\n  networking platforms and plugins, you share your information with them and their\n  privacy policy applies to their collection, use, and disclosure of such information. In\n  addition, they may be able to collect information about you, including your activity on\n  the Nickelodeon Sites, and they may notify your connections on the social networking\n  platform about your use of the Nickelodeon Sites. Such services may also employ unique\n  identifiers which allow your activity to be monitored across multiple websites for\n  purposes of delivering more targeted advertising to you.

An Identifier may be\n  automatically assigned to any device you use to access the Nickelodeon Sites.\n  By visiting a Site,\n  whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree\n  that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of a Site\n  through these Tracking Technologies and Identifiers and that we may use Tracking\n  Technologies in the emails we send to you.\n  The Nickelodeon Sites\n  adhere to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Click here for more information about the\n  Nickelodeon Sites and online behavioral advertising. On sites that are directed to\n  children under 13 or where Nickelodeon has actual knowledge that a user is under 13,\n  Nickelodeon does not direct targeted advertising to such children based on the\n  child\u2019s visits to the Nickelodeon Sites and other websites that the child\n  visited.\n  Our Third Party\n  Advertising Service Providers (as defined in Section D) do not have access to Tracking\n  Technologies set by the Nickelodeon Sites except to the extent necessary to provide\n  services to the Site. The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as\n  advertisers, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your\n  Device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for\n  Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to\n  other information about you.\n  You\n  have a number of options with respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the\n  Nickelodeon Sites:\n  \n      You can prevent the use of\n      certain Tracking Technologies (other than Flash cookies) by using the controls in\n      your Web browser. To do so, you must complete both of the following steps:\n    \n  \n      Delete existing Tracking\n      Technologies through the \u201cInternet Options\u201d sub-option of the\n      \u201cTools\u201d menu option of your browser or otherwise as directed by your\n      browser\u2019s support feature; and\n    \n    \n      Disable future Tracking\n      Technologies by using the same browser controls. Additional information on\n      disabling most Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser\u2019s\n      support feature. (See the \u201chelp\u201d section of your browser for more\n      information.)\n    \n  \n      You may be able to have the\n      device you use to access the Nickelodeon Sites warn you each time a cookie or most\n      other Tracking Technologies is being set (other than Flash cookies), or you can\n      choose to turn off such warnings. This is done through your browser on the device\n      you use to access the Nickelodeon Sites. Additional information on warnings and\n      removal of warnings may be available through your browser\u2019s support\n      feature.\n    \n  Please note that\n  deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Tracking Technologies through the above\n  options will not remove Flash cookies. For more information about Flash cookies and how\n  to remove them from your computer, please visit here\n  Please be aware that\n  certain areas and features of Nickelodeon Sites can only be accessed in conjunction\n  with Tracking Technologies, and that disabling Tracking Technologies might prevent you\n  from accessing such content.\n\n   D. Computer\n  Information Collected By Others: Nickelodeon Sites use a variety of third-party\n  advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing\n  analytics service providers, and other third-party service providers (collectively,\n  \u201cThird Party Advertising Service Providers\u201d) to, for example, serve\n  advertisements on the Nickelodeon Sites, facilitate targeting of advertisements, and\n  measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Nickelodeon Sites\n  (\u201cTargeting Services\u201d). These Targeting Services enable us to display\n  advertisements based on your visits to the Nickelodeon Sites and other websites you\n  have visited and may include delivering advertisements or other content for products\n  and services that may interest you. Targeting Services also help prevent you from\n  seeing repeated advertisements and enable us to research the usefulness of certain\n  advertisements. On sites that are directed to children under 13 or where Nickelodeon\n  has actual knowledge that a user is under 13, Nickelodeon does not direct targeted\n  advertising to such children based on the child\u2019s visits to the Nickelodeon Sites\n  and other websites that the child visited.\n  These Third Party\n  Advertising Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the\n  Nickelodeon Sites except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Nickelodeon\n  Sites. The Third Party Advertising Service Providers, as well as advertisers, may\n  themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your device if you choose\n  to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you\n  have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise have access to Other Information about\n  you. In addition, Third Party Advertising Service Providers may collect aggregate log\n  data separately and independently from what the Nickelodeon Sites collect.\n  You should be aware that\n  different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by\n  third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other websites\n  you encounter on the Internet. The use of such technology by these third parties is\n  within their control and not the Nickelodeon Sites. Even if we have a relationship with\n  the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and practices\n  regarding your information and this Privacy Policy does not cover any use of\n  information that they may collect from you. We encourage you to research and direct any\n  of your questions in this regard to these third parties. Use of a third party\u2019s\n  Tracking Technology is subject to their own privacy policies.\n  With respect to the\n  Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and advertisers\n  (and outside the control of the Nickelodeon Sites), you have a number of options:\n \n  \n      You can opt-out of the use of\n      information for these advertising purposes by two such Third Party Advertising\n      Service Providers, Demdex and DoubleClick by using those Providers\u2019 opt-out\n      tools.\u00a0 You can access Demdex\u2019s tool at http://www.donottarget.com/ and\n      DoubleClick\u2019s at http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/ads/.\u00a0\n      We also may from time to time permit other Third Party Advertising Service\n      Providers and Advertisers to collect Information on the Nickelodeon Sites.\u00a0\n      Some of these Providers and Advertisers may participate in the Network\n      Advertising Initiative\u2019s Opt-Out Tool \n      and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising\n      Please click on the links to these tools to learn more about your\n      choices.\u00a0\n    \n  \n      Please note the following with\n      respect to opting out of Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Advertising\n      Service Providers and advertisers:\n    \n  \n    \n        The opt-out tools\n        discussed above are \u201ccookie based.\u201d This means that\n        the tools rely on cookies to remember your choices with respect to the use of\n        your information by the parties that offer you those choices. If you opt-out but\n        then use the controls in your browser to delete all Tracking Technologies, you\n        may have to opt-out again, a second time, in order to re-establish your opt-out\n        preferences.\n      \n    \n \n  \n    \n        Opt-outs are\n        browser-specific. This means, for example, that if you opt out while\n        using Internet Explorer 9, this choice will not affect the collection of\n        information collected by Tracking Technologies when you use Mozilla Firefox on\n        the same device. It also means that opting out on one device will not affect the\n        collection of information by Tracking Technologies on other devices you may use\n        to access the Nickelodeon Sites.\n      \n    \n \n  \n      You also can prevent the use of\n      certain Tracking Technologies (other than Flash cookies) on a particular device by\n      using the controls in your Web browser. To do so, you must complete both of the\n      following steps:\n    \n  \n    \n        Delete existing Tracking\n        Technologies through the \u201cInternet Options\u201d sub-option of the\n        \u201cTools\u201d menu option of your browser or otherwise as directed by your\n        browser\u2019s support feature; and\n      \n      \n        Disable future Tracking\n        Technologies by using the same browser controls. Additional information on\n        disabling most Tracking Technologies may be available through your\n        browser\u2019s support feature. (See the \u201chelp\u201d section of your\n        browser for more information.)\n      \n    \n  \n  \n      You may be able to set the\n      device you use to access the Nickelodeon Sites\n      warn you each time a cookie or most other Tracking Technologies is being set (other\n      than Flash cookies), or you can choose to turn off such warnings. This is done\n      through your browser on the device you use to access the Nickelodeon Sites.\n      Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through\n      your browser\u2019s support feature.\n    \n  \n      Opting-out of, deleting,\n      rejecting, disabling or turning off Third Party Advertising Service\n      Providers\u2019 Tracking Technologies does not mean that you will no longer\n      receive online ads. Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off\n      Third Party Advertising Service Providers\u2019 Tracking Technologies only means\n      that such ads will no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or\n      interests, but you will continue to see ads on the Nickelodeon Sites.\n    \n  \n      PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND\n      STORAGE OF FLASH COOKIES TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR BROWSER. For\n      more information about Flash cookies and how to remove them from your computer,\n      please visit here\n    \n  E.\u00a0Contests and\n  Sweepstakes:\u00a0 The Nickelodeon Sites may offer online contests and sweepstakes.\n  To enter these contests and sweepstakes, you may be required to provide your first name\n  and email address and/or additional information required for the management of the\n  contest or sweepstakes.\u00a0 On sites that either are directed to children under 13 or\n  where we have actual knowledge that a user is a child under 13, we may collect the\n  child\u2019s e-mail address to enter the child in the contest or sweepstakes, store\n  such child\u2019s email address for the duration of the sweepstakes, and use it for\n  notification if he or she is the winner. For certain contests or sweepstakes on such\n  sites, we may ask for the email address of the child's parent or guardian to inform the\n  parent or guardian of his or her child's entry and give the parent or guardian the\n  option to have the child's entry deleted.\n\n  F.\u00a0\n  Electronic Postcards and Messages: Some Nickelodeon Sites provide visitors the\n  opportunity to send electronic postcards and \u201cwish lists\u201d of items they\n  want to family or friends, which means we will send, on the visitor\u2019s behalf,\n  email messages to family and/or friends. To do so, visitors must provide the email\n  address of the recipient of such electronic postcards or email messages. Email\n  addresses provided to us for this purpose are used solely to send the requested\n  postcard or email message and are deleted from our system once the postcard or message\n  is sent.\u00a0 In some cases, we may offer visitors an incentive (e.g., points\n  to be used in an online game) for referring information about products to the visitor's\n  family or friends.\u00a0\u00a0In such cases, we will comply with all applicable legal\n  requirements. Please note that this feature may not be available to visitors in certain\n  regions.\n\n  \n  G.\u00a0Electronic Newsletters: Visitors can provide their email addresses to\n  receive email newsletters and promotions from the Nickelodeon Group, the Viacom family\n  of companies, and our business partners.\u00a0 Visitors may change their preferences\n  regarding emails at any time through the unsubscribe link in the newsletters or, for\n  certain Nickelodeon Sites, by logging into and changing the preferences for their\n  account.\u00a0\n  When visitors to\n  Nickelodeon Sites that either are directed to children under 13 or have actual\n  knowledge that a user is a child under 13 years old ask to receive our email\n  newsletter(s), they\u00a0will be asked to provide their first name, email address and\n  the email address of their parent/guardian. We will send the child's parent/guardian a\n  notification email informing them of the child's request to receive by email the\n  newsletter on an ongoing basis and give the parent/guardian the option to have his or\n  her child's information removed from our newsletter database. The link to remove the\n  child\u2019s information will expire approximately 48 hours from the time it is sent,\n  but at any time after receiving this notification email, the child's parent/guardian\n  may request that we stop sending the child the newsletter(s) by following the\n  \"unsubscribe\" instructions found at the end of any of the newsletter emails.\u00a0\n  Parents/guardians may at any time review any personally identifiable information\n  collected online about their child. See section V (B) below. When a child provides a\n  parent's/guardian's email address when signing up for newsletter(s), that email address\n  is used to send the notification email message and is subsequently deleted from our\n  system.\n\n  H. Interactive\n  Features and Services: Some of the Nickelodeon Sites offer interactive features and\n  services, such as message boards, chat rooms, electronic mail services, comment boxes,\n  messaging services, and member profile pages. For certain countries, on Nickelodeon\n  Sites that either are directed to children under 13 or have actual knowledge that a\n  user is a child under 13 years old, we either will obtain the consent of the\n  child\u2019s parent before allowing the child to use these interactive features and\n  services or will use reasonable technical measures to delete all or virtually all\n  personal information from a child\u2019s postings before they are made public and also\n  delete such information from our records. We use the information collected through\n  interactive features and services to enable you to participate in such features and\n  services.\n\n  I. Wireless Marketing\n  Services: Consistent with local law, appropriately aged visitors may have the\n  opportunity to register for special promotions, services, news, programming and\n  information delivered via text messaging and/or wireless devices.

For example, we may partner with a\n  greeting card company, software manufacturer, social media plugin provider, or mobile\n  phone provider to offer you electronic cards, games, social networking, or text\n  messaging services. These partners operate websites and services that are separate and\n  independent from the Nickelodeon Sites and, accordingly, may have their own privacy\n  policies.\u00a0 If you consent or register with one of our partners, that means you\n  grant the Nickelodeon Sites permission to give your registration and other information,\n  including e-mail address, to that third party.\u00a0\u00a0If you have identified\n  yourself as residing in the EU, we will not share your email address or other\n  personally identifiable information with third parties for advertising purposes unless\n  you have \"opted-in.\"\n\n  In addition, Third Party\n  Advertising Service Providers may use their own Tracking Technologies to gather\n  information about you.

Business Transfer\n  In the event that assets\n  relating to one or more of the Nickelodeon Sites are transferred or sold to another\n  entity as a result of, for example, a corporate sale, merger, consolidation, asset\n  sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, information collected at the Nickelodeon\n  Sites may be transferred to the acquiring company.\n\n   G.
