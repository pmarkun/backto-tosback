For example, through these means, we may collect your browser type and operating system, viewed webpages, links that are clicked, IP address, sites visited before coming to our website, emails we send that you open, forward, or click through to our website. Collecting this information, and linking it with your personally-identifiable information, helps us to best tailor our website and enhance your online experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site, and to help identify site features, recipes, advertisements, and offers that may be of particular interest to you.\r\nWe also may use third party advertisements placed by ad networks to support our site. Some of these advertisers and ad networks may use technology such as cookies and web beacons/pixel tags when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers and ad networks information including your IP address, your ISP, the browser you used to visit our site, and whether you have Flash installed. Some of these advertisers and ad networks also may use anonymous data, such as demographic data, received from third parties to assist in the delivery of advertisements to you. These advertisers and ad networks use the information described above to provide you relevant advertisements based on your online behavior, search activities on our site and on other third party sites, demographic information and/or relevant to your general location, so that the advertising you see on our site more closely reflects your interests and needs. For example, if you search for, or browse a, recipe or product on our site, you may see an advertisement from a third party with information about, or an offer similar to, that for which you were searching or browsing on our site, or an offer related to a third party whose site you have visited in the past.\r\nYou can set your Internet browser settings to stop accepting new cookies, to receive notice when you receive a new cookie, to disable existing cookies, and to omit images (which will disable pixel tags).

For example, we may (i) send you promotional offers, materials, and other communications and information about Kraft, its portfolio of brands and its partners, (ii) respond to your comments or questions, or (iii) contact you if needed while processing a product or service you requested through our website. We also may use the information you provide to contact you for your opinions on Kraft products, services or websites. As described in this Privacy Notice, we also use the information we collect about you to improve our website, products and services, and to deliver content that is customized to your interests.\r\nHow We Share Your Information\r\n\r\nWe do not sell or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information about our website visitors, except as described here. We do not share your personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties for their own marketing purposes without your consent. For California residents, please see \u00e2\u0080\u009cYour California Privacy Rights\u00e2\u0080\u009d below.\r\nWe may share personally identifiable information among Kraft brands and subsidiaries. We may also share the information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf, such as to help run promotions, fulfill orders and provide customer service. These service providers may have access to personally-identifiable information about our website visitors if it is needed to perform their functions for Kraft, but they are not authorized by Kraft to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on Kraft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s behalf or to comply with legal requirements. In addition, we may disclose information where we think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary to investigate or prevent an actual or suspected crime or injury to ourselves or others, if required by law, or in response to a request from law enforcement authorities or other government officials.\r\nWe may conduct joint promotions with other companies. We may share with our promotional partners (and their service providers) certain personally-identifiable information as necessary to conduct the promotion. We will not share this information with our promotional partners for any other purpose unless you consent to such sharing.\r\nDuring the normal course of our business, Kraft may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires us or any of our assets, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity. In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, such information may be considered an asset of ours and may be sold or transferred to third parties. Should a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personally identifiable information provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.\r\n\r\nYour California Privacy Rights\r\nFor California Residents: We may share your personally-identifiable information with affiliated third parties, some of which do not share the Kraft name, for their own direct marketing purposes. Because this category of affiliates is considered to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cunaffiliated parties\u00e2\u0080\u009d under California Law, you may opt out of us sharing with them. To opt out, please send a letter with your name, postal address, e-mail, with the heading \u00e2\u0080\u009cCalifornia Privacy Rights\u00e2\u0080\u009d to: \r\nKraft Foods Group, Inc.\r\n1 Kraft Court\r\nGlenview, IL 60025\r\nAttention: Consumer Relations \r\n\r\nLinks To Other Websites\r\nThis website may contain links to other websites. We provide these links solely for your convenience and information. Different websites have different privacy practices. You should always check the privacy notice of the specific site you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re visiting to understand the privacy practices associated with that site. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third party websites.\r\nYour Choices\r\nYou can change your preferences for follow-up contacts by Kraft. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re registered with our website, you can change the information you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve provided to us in the \"Your Profile\" section of the site.

E-mail us if you wish to take this action.\r\n\r\nChildren's Privacy\r\n\r\nSome portions of our website may be directed to children under 13. In these areas of our website, our conduct is governed by federal law and regulations that address children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s online privacy, as well as by the guidelines of the Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Advertising Review Unit (CARU), a part of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you are under 13, please be sure to read this notice with your parent or legal guardian.\r\nWe do not knowingly collect personally-identifiable information from children under 13 on our website, except as permitted by legal requirements and the CARU guidelines. We sometimes offer promotions on our website, such as contests, sweepstakes and games, which children may enter. In those cases, we do not require a child to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the promotion as a condition of participation. If we need more than just your child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first name (or screen name) and e-mail address for your child to participate in a particular online promotion, we will ask your child for your e-mail address so that we can notify you of your child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request and obtain your permission. When we ask for your permission, we will tell you what we will do with the information that you or your child provides us. In addition, if a child under 13 signs up with us for an email newsletter or other online activity that requires more than one online contact, we also ask the child for your email address so that we can notify you and give you the opportunity to opt your child out of further communications from us. Unless you have explicitly consented, we do not (i) use your child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal information for any purpose other than to complete the promotion or (ii) share the information with third parties except as described above in this Privacy Notice. We do not keep your (or your child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s) email address unless you tell us it is okay.\r\nWe permit children under the age of 13 to contact us through the website \"Contact Us\" link with questions or comments. We request only the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first name and e-mail address and use that information solely to respond directly to the child on a one-time basis. We do not use the information to recontact the child and we delete the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s personal information from our database after responding to the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inquiry.\r\nUpon proper identification, a parent may review any personal information we have collected from his or her child if we still have the information in our database. The parent also may request that the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s information be deleted from our database and may refuse to permit further collection or use of the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s information. If you are a parent and wish to exercise these rights, please contact us as described below.\r\nHow We Protect Your Information\r\n\r\n\r\nThe security of personally-identifiable information is important to us. We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against unauthorized use, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the personally-identifiable information we collect on this website.\r\nUpdates To This Privacy Notice\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may change or update portions of this Privacy Notice at any time. Please check back from time to time so you are aware of any changes or updates to the notice. We will indicate the notice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s effective date on the first page of the notice.\r\n\r\nHow To Contact Us \r\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Notice, you can contact us at:\r\nKraft Foods Group, Inc.\r\n1 Kraft Court\r\nGlenview, IL 60025\r\nAttention: Consumer Relations Group\r\n1-800-543-5335\r\n9 a.m. - 5 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.\r\nE-mail us.\r\nWe would be happy to answer your questions or hear your concerns.\r\n\u00a9 2011 Kraft Foods\r\nPrinter-Friendly VersionSend to a Friend\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t",
