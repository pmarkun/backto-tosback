Security and Protection of Customer Information \n           Security \n            Passwords You must not share your password for any message services or Portal access. Your passwords and the answers to secret questions are your responsibility, and must not be disclosed to any third party. This is also important for your own protection.  \n             Data Security Procedures We are constantly reviewing our procedures to protect your personal data from unauthorised access, accidental loss and/or destruction. We use industry standard secure socket layer (SSL) technology to encrypt sensitive information such as financial information, e.g. your credit card. We may employ third parties to provide services on our behalf. In such cases, if they collect any data on their own behalf they will provide their own privacy policy. We do endeavour to ensure that any partners we use apply the same high standards of privacy and security over your information. However, we advise you to read their policy carefully. \n              Security of Communications Please be aware that communications over the Internet, such as e-mails and Webmails, are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may route through a number of countries before being delivered - this is the nature of the World Wide Web/Internet. O2 cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control. \n                Media Messaging If you are registered with www.o2.co.uk, any Media Messages you send to an email address, including Media Messages from your phone and messages from www.o2.co.uk, may include personal details such as your registered first name and last name, your phone number or email address which will be displayed in the 'from' field of the message. \n               O2 Chat rooms and Opinion Forums You are reminded that chat rooms and opinion forums are for public discussion. Any personal information that you choose to supply when you participate in these discussions is widely accessible. Never reveal any personal information such as your telephone number, postal or email address when you participate in these discussions. \n               \n             \n            Users 16 and under If you are aged 16 or under, please get your parent or guardian's permission before providing any personal information or before taking part in any www.o2.co.uk discussion. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information.  \n             Co-Branded Micro Sites and Third Party Sites Some web pages and Micro Websites included within O2's websites may be co-branded with third party names, logos, or properties. These Micro Websites are operated or maintained by or on behalf of O2. While such third parties are sponsors of these web pages or Micro Websites, the third parties do not share in any personally identifiable information collected within those web pages or Micro Websites unless otherwise stated. This policy does not apply to third party sites that you may access via our Portals. You should therefore ensure that you are familiar with the applicable third party privacy policy before entering any personal information on a third party site. \n             Non-EEA Use of Information The information you provide to us may be passed to third parties located outside the European Economic Area. Countries outside the European Economic Area do not always have strong data protection laws. However we will always take steps to ensure that your information is used by third parties in accordance with this policy. Additional terms and conditions may be presented when signing up for specific products and Services. \n              Marketing Information from Third Parties If you choose to receive marketing information from other companies, we will only disclose your personal information to these companies where they have undertaken not to use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide information to you or other uses to which you have agreed. If you decide that you no longer want to receive information from a particular company, you should contact that company directly. You should be aware that if you subsequently give any personal information to another company, the uses to which that information may be put will be determined by that company's privacy policy. \n             \n             Cookies A \"cookie\" is a piece of information, like a tag, which some websites create on your PC/mobile phone which identifies your PC/mobile phone whenever you visit that website. In order to provide you with the best possible online experience, O2 may create cookies when you visit the O2 site. In order to help you, cookies may be used to: \n              limit the frequency with which you will see particular advertisements or O2 announcements on the site; \n              identify your defaults if you have set up a customised homepage; \n              keep track of how many times you do specific things whilst using the Services; \n              track where you have come from if you were referred to our Portal; \n              provide you with self-help information; and \n              make our email offers more relevant to you by taking into account your response to previous email offers. \n              \n             Agents of O2, who assist in the serving and targeting of advertisements, promotions and other marketing messages, may use cookies to collect anonymous data such as how many people have viewed a particular page each day. Data collected by cookies will not otherwise be passed to any third party.  \n              You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most PCs automatically accept them but you can modify your browser settings to decline if you so wish - click here to switch off cookies on your browser. If you decline cookies, some aspects of the O2 site may not work on your PC/mobile phone and you may not be able to access areas you want on the website. For this reason we recommend that you accept cookies. If you select the 'Remember Me' function, where it is available, for any return visits, you will need to have cookies enabled on your browser.  \n              Finally, please note that advertisers and other third parties may use their own cookies or action tags when you click on their advertisement or link to their website or service, on or from our website. These third parties are responsible for setting out their own cookie and privacy policies.  FAQS on other related issues \n             Location Information Some web and mobile telephone Services that you use from your O2 mobile may require us to disclose information about the location of your mobile phone to third parties. By using location-based Services such as 'Find My Nearest ATM' or 'Friend Finder', you consent to O2 disclosing your information to third parties who provide you with the service. The information that we provide to third parties will be an approximate location only. However if you do not wish your location to be disclosed for some or all Services, please call our Location Services Privacy Controller (LSPC) by dialing 1300, free of charge from your O2 mobile (for non-O2 customers, please contact your network provider). If you have contacted the LSPC and decided to withhold your location information you may not be able to access certain Services that require this information. You can control how the location of your mobile is used to provide you with Services by dialing the O2 Location Services Privacy Controller on 1300, free of charge from your O2 mobile.  \n               How to avoid receiving Spam \n                Think before you give out your e-mail address Try to avoid giving your main e-mail address on web sites, chat rooms, newsgroups or to companies. There are many places online that provide free e-mail accounts. You could set up a separate account to use when signing up to an Internet service, or for online shopping. This way your main e-mail address cannot be \"harvested\" by spammers. Avoid forwarding chain letters or petitions. These lists of addresses can be used by spammers. \n                 Never reply to Spam This includes the notorious \"click here to unsubscribe\" trick. While it looks as if you are being given a chance to opt out of receiving further unsolicited e-mail, in fact you will be letting the spammer know that your e-mail address is active, leading to yet more Spam being sent. Don't click it - just delete the e-mail. You should also avoid trying to Spam the spammers, you will end up being blacklisted as a spammer yourself. \n                Blocks and Filters Your Webmail has simple Spam blocking features already. Have a look for the pages on \"spam\" or \"junk mail\" in the 'Help' section of the Webmail service. If you are downloading emails onto your home PC, then email your Internet Service Provider or search their website to find out about Spam blocking services they may offer. There are various software programs to help you block Spam. \n                 To prevent cold calling to your mobile phone, you should register your number with the Telephone Preference Service.
