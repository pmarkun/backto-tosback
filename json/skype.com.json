There are, however, a few key points that we need to emphasise:\nNO ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES: The Software is not a replacement for your ordinary mobile or fixed line telephone. In particular, apart from in the very limited circumstances set out in paragraph 5.6 of these Terms (applicable to Skype\u2019s Internet Communications Software only), the Software does not allow you to make emergency calls to emergency services. You must make alternative communications arrangements to ensure that you can make emergency calls if needed.  \nCHECK RESTRICTIONS ON USE: In some countries there are restrictions on the use of the Software. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally allowed to use the Software where you are located. \nNO OWNERSHIP OF NUMBERS: If Skype allocates you an Online Number or Skype To Go Number, you do not own number or have a right to retain that number forever.  Skype may need to change or withdraw the number allocated to you from time to time. You will not transfer or attempt to transfer your Online Number or Skype To Go Number to anyone else. You must ensure you comply with any allocation requirements displayed when purchasing an Online Number as failure to do so could result in the number being withdrawn. Please see also paragraph 19.1.\nSKYPE CREDIT BECOMES INACTIVE AFTER 180 DAYS: If you purchase Skype Credit please be aware that it becomes inactive after 180 days of inactivity. Please see also paragraph 9.2.\n\n\n   \n      \n    1. YOUR AGREEMENT WITH SKYPE \n    \n   \n    1.1 Skype\u2019s internet communication software applications (\u201cInternet Communications Software\u201d), other \u2018Skype\u2019 branded software applications (together the \u201cSkype Software\u201d), the \u201cQik\u201d branded software applications (\u201cQik Software\u201d) and associated documentation (whether in printed or electronic form) including any improvements, modifications, enhancements, fixes, updates, upgrades and future versions thereto (\u201cUpdates\u201d) and whether made available for free or for a fee, (collectively the \u201cSoftware\u201d) is licensed (not sold) to you by Skype Software S\u00e0rl. \n    \n   \n    1.2 The features and products that are made available through the Software for free (excluding products or features available for free on a trial basis only) (\u201cFree Products\u201d) are provided to you by Skype Software S\u00e0rl.\n    \n   \n    1.3 Any additional products or features of the Skype Software or Qik Software, or other \u201cSkype\u201d or \u201cQik\u201d branded products, that you pay for (including products or features which are available for free on a trial basis only) (\u201cPaid For Products\u201d) are provided to you by Skype Communications S\u00e0rl. \n  \n1.4 Skype\u2019s websites www.skype.com or www.qik.com (as applicable) (\u201cSkype Website(s)\u201d) are operated by Skype Communications S\u00e0rl.  \n1.5  \u201cSkype\u2019\u2019 means Skype Software S\u00e0rl, 23 \u2013 29 Rives de Clausen, L-2165 Luxembourg, Skype Communications S\u00e0rl, 23 \u2013 29 Rives de Clausen, L-2165 Luxembourg, or Skype, Inc, 3210 Porter Drive, Palo Alto, California, 94304, USA as the context requires; \n\u201cProducts\u201d means collectively the Free Products and Paid For Products; \n\u201cyou\u201d or \u201cyour\u201d means you, the registered holder of the User Account (as described in paragraph 6.1) and licensee under these Terms.   \n 1.6 Your agreement with Skype is made up of the terms and conditions set out in this document, together with any fair usage policies described in this document and Additional Terms referred to in paragraph 14 (collectively the \u201cTerms\u201d). To the extent of any inconsistency between the fair usage policies or any Additional Terms and this document, this document shall take precedence.    \n \n   \n      \n    2. ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS \n    \n  2.1 In order to download and/or use the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites you must first accept these Terms. These Terms are accepted by you (a) when you click to accept or agree the Terms; or (b) when you download and/or use the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites. We advise you to print a copy of these Terms for your records. These Terms remain effective from the date of acceptance until terminated by you or Skype in accordance with paragraph 11.   \n 2.2 You cannot accept these Terms if: (a) you are not lawfully entitled to use the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites in the country in which you are located or resident or (b) if you are not of legal age to form a binding agreement with Skype. \n 2.3 In some countries the Products may be provided to you by Skype\u2019s local partner. If so, that local partner may ask you to accept its own terms of service (\u201clocal terms\u201d). If there is any inconsistency between those local terms and these Terms, then the local terms shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.\n\n   \n      \n    3. CHANGES TO THE TERMS \n    \n 3.1 Skype may make changes to these Terms from time to time. Skype will publish the changes at www.skype.com/go/tou . Changes to the fair usage policies and/or Additional Terms will be posted on the applicable Skype Website. The changes will be effective when published. Please review the Terms on a regular basis. You understand and agree that your express acceptance of the Terms or your use of the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites after the date of publication shall constitute your agreement to the updated Terms. If you do not agree with the amended Terms, you may terminate your relationship with Skype in accordance with paragraph 11 below.\n   \n      \n    4. LICENCE \n    \n   \n    4.1 Licence. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, free of charge license to download and install the Software on a personal computer, mobile phone or other device; and personally use the Software through your individual Skype or Qik user account (as applicable) (\u201cUser Account\u201d). For the avoidance of doubt, (a) IT administrators working on behalf of a company may download and install the Skype Software onto personal computers or other devices used by personnel of such company; and (b) you are permitted to use the Software at a university or other educational institution, or at work. Skype reserves all rights not expressly granted to you under these Terms. \n    \n   \n    4.2 Restrictions. You may not and you agree not to.\n    \n(a) sub-license, sell, assign, rent, lease, export, import, distribute or transfer or otherwise grant rights to any third party in the Software;\n(b) undertake, cause, permit or authorize the modification, creation of derivative works or improvements, translation, reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling, decryption, emulation, hacking, discovery or attempted discovery of the source code or protocols of the Software or any part or features thereof (except to the extent permitted by law);\n(c) remove, obscure or alter any copyright notices or other proprietary notices included in the Software;\n(d) use the Software or cause the Software (or any part of it) to be used within or to provide commercial products or services to third parties. The foregoing shall not preclude you using the Software for your own business communications, subject to Section 4.1 above;\n(e) other than for the purposes of download and installation, use the Software except through your User Account. \n   \n    4.3 Third Party Technology. If you are using Software pre-loaded on, embedded in, combined, distributed or used with or downloaded onto third party products, hardware, software applications, programs or devices (\u201cThird Party Technology\u201d), you agree and acknowledge that: (a) you may be required to enter into a separate licence agreement with the relevant third party owner or licensor for the use of such Third Party Technology; (b) some Products and/or functionality may not be accessible through the Third Party Technology and (c) Skype cannot guarantee that the Software shall always be available on or in connection with such Third Party Technology. \n  \n  \n4.4  Third Party Notices.  The Software may include third party code that Skype, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement.  Notices, if any, for the third party code are included for your information only.  Third party scripts, linked to, called or referenced from the Software, are licensed to you by the third parties that own such code, not by Skype. \n   \n      \n    5. USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS AND SKYPE WEBSITES \n    \n   \n    5.1 Equipment: In order to use the Software and the Products you will need an Internet broadband connection. You are responsible for providing all equipment required to access the Internet or enable communications such as headsets, microphones and webcams. \n    \n   \n    5.2 Use of Your Equipment: The Internet Communications Software may use the processing capabilities, memory and bandwidth of the computer (or other applicable device) you are using, for the limited purpose of facilitating the communication and establishing the connection between Internet Communications Software users. If your use of the Internet Communications Software is dependent upon the use of a processor and bandwidth owned or controlled by a third party, you acknowledge and agree that your licence to use the Internet Communications Software is subject to you obtaining consent from the relevant third party for such use. You represent and warrant that by accepting these Terms, you have obtained such consent.\n    \n   \n    5.3 Updates to the Software:  Skype may automatically check your version of the Skype Software. You may be required to enter into an updated version of these Terms to be able to download or otherwise take advantage of any Updates. Skype has no obligation to make available any Updates. However, Skype may (a) require you to download and install Updates; or (b) download and install Updates from Skype automatically from time to time unless you have chosen (through your Skype client settings) not to receive automatic Updates. Microsoft may also automatically download updates to the Skype Software for Windows, if you have chosen to receive Microsoft Updates. These updates are required to maintain software compatibility, provide security updates or bug fixes, or offer new features, functionality or versions. You agree to receive such updates from Skype in order to continue using the Skype Software and you agree to accept such Updates subject to these Terms. \n    \n   5.4 Suspension, technical improvement and maintenance: From time to time, Skype may need to perform maintenance on or upgrade the Software, Products or Skype Websites or the underlying infrastructure that enables you to use the Software, Products or Skype Websites. This may require Skype to temporarily suspend or limit your use of some or all of the Software, Products or Skype Websites until such time as this maintenance and/or upgrade can be completed. To the extent possible and unless an intervention is urgently required, Skype will publish the time and date of such suspension or limitation on the Skype Website in advance. You will not be entitled to claim damages for such suspension or limitation of the use of any Software, Product or Skype Website.\n5.5 No Access to Emergency Services: Neither the Products nor the Software are intended to support or carry emergency calls to any type of hospitals, law enforcement agencies, medical care unit or any other kind of services that connect a user to emergency services personnel or public safety answering points (\u2018Emergency Services\u2019) . There are important differences between traditional telephone services and the Products. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Skype is not required to offer access to Emergency Services under any applicable local and/or national rules, regulations or law; (ii) it is your responsibility to purchase, separately from the Products, traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services that offer access to Emergency Services, and (iii) the Software and the Products are not a replacement for your primary telephone service. Find out more about calling 112, the dedicated emergency number for the EU at www.skype.com/go/emergency.\n   \n    5.6 Limited Emergency Calling (Internet Communications Software Only and Not Applicable to the Qik Software) \n  \n5.6.1 In a very limited number of countries, and for defined Internet Communications Software versions and platforms only, Skype will try to provide limited emergency calling as a stand-alone feature but can provide no commitment in this respect.  Click here for the listing of countries (\u2018Enabled Countries\u2019) and software versions and other platforms (\u2018Enabled Versions\u2019) that enable limited Skype emergency calling. Skype emergency calling is not available for any other countries, versions or platforms. You should keep traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services available for your calls to Emergency Services and use Skype\u2019s limited emergency calling only as an absolute last resort. In particular, please also note that:  \n  (i) \n   power cut, battery failure or internet connection failure can lead to a Skype call failure, including your call to Emergency Services. Additionally, any of the quality limitations set out in paragraph 5.9 below, may otherwise affect successful call connection. \n    \n  (ii) where available, an emergency call made using the Internet Communications Software in an enabled country may not receive the same network priority as a call made using traditional wireless (mobile) or fixed line telephone services.   \n  (iii) if your emergency call is connected, you will need to tell the Emergency Services operator that you speak to where you are physically located so that the correct emergency organisation can respond to your emergency and knows where to find you. If you do not provide this information when prompted, you acknowledge that your emergency call may not be completed and you will not be able to gain access to your required Emergency Services using the Internet Communications Software. Skype will have no liability for your failed emergency call in such circumstances.  \n  (iv) other than for the Enabled Countries and Enabled Versions, Skype does not provide limited emergency calling in any country or for or in conjunction with any Products or using any platforms, devices, services or operating systems (including any products, platforms, devices, services or operating systems developed by third parties using  Skype\u2019s APIs, any of Skype\u2019s software development kits or otherwise).    \n   \n    5.6.2 In Enabled Countries, you should configure the limited emergency calling functionality by setting your default location for emergency calling in the Call Settings page of your desktop Internet Communications Software (if you are using a 4.1 version for Windows (or later) or version 2.8 for Mac OS X (or later)). It is your responsibility to ensure that this location information is correct and kept up-to-date if your physical address changes. Skype does not support emergency calls in the majority of countries around the world. Where limited emergency calling  is supported Skype will not charge you to make an emergency call and you do not need to have a Skype Credit balance. If however your country is not supported for limited emergency calling then you should not attempt to, and agree not to, make any emergency calls using your Internet Communications Software. If, with your permission, another user uses your User Account, it is your responsibility to inform that user of the limited circumstances in which limited emergency calling is available.\n    \n \n5.7 Content of Communications: Skype is not the source of, does not verify or endorse  and takes no responsibility for the content of communications made using the Software. By using the Software, you agree that any content that you submit may be transmitted to the recipient of your communication. The content of communications is entirely the responsibility of the person from whom such content originated. You therefore may be exposed to content that is offensive, unlawful, harmful to minors, obscene, indecent or otherwise objectionable. The content of communications may be protected by intellectual property rights, which are owned by third parties. You are responsible for the content you choose to communicate and access using the Software. In particular, you are responsible for ensuring that you do not submit material that is (i) copyrighted, protected by trade secret or otherwise subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy and publicity rights, unless you are the owner of such rights or have permission from their rightful owner (ii) a falsehood or misrepresentation (iii) offensive, unlawful, harmful to minors, obscene, defamatory, libellous, threatening, pornographic, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive, or that encourages conduct that would be considered a criminal offense, gives rise to civil liability, violates any law, or is otherwise objectionable; (iv) an advertisement or solicitation of business; or (v) impersonating another person. Skype reserves the right (but shall have no obligation) to review content for the purpose of enforcing these Terms. Skype may in its sole discretion block, prevent delivery of or otherwise remove the content of communications as part of its effort to protect the Software, Products or its customers, or otherwise enforce these Terms. Further, Skype may in its sole discretion remove such content and/or terminate these Terms and your User Account if you use any content that is in breach of these Terms.\n5.8 Notice and Take-Down If Skype receives any notification that any material that you post, upload, edit, host, share and/or publish on the Skype Website or through the Software (excluding your private communications) (\u201cUser Submission\u201d) is inappropriate, infringes any rights of any third party, or if Skype wishes to remove your User Submission for any reason whatsoever, Skype reserves the right to automatically remove such User Submission for any reason immediately or within such other timescales as may be decided from time to time by Skype in its sole discretion. The User Submission shall be taken down without any admission as to liability and without prejudice to any rights, remedies or defenses, all of which are expressly reserved. You acknowledge and agree that Skype is under no obligation to put back such User Submission at any time. If User Submissions infringe, or if you believe that User Submissions infringe any of your rights (including intellectual property rights) or are unlawful, please contact us immediately by following our notice and takedown procedure. Click here to view the Notice and Takedown Procedure. Skype reserves the right to ask for verification of your identity and to seek further information to verify your complaint. You agree that you are solely responsible for the consequences resulting from your complaint (including but not limited to removal or blocking of the User Submission) and you acknowledge and agree that any complaint may be used in court proceedings. Any false, misleading or inaccurate information provided by you may result in civil and criminal liability. \n5.9 Quality: Skype cannot guarantee that the Software, Products or Skype Websites will always function without disruptions, delay or errors. A number of factors may impact the quality of your communications and use of the Software, Products (depending on the Products used) or Skype Websites, and may result in the failure of your communications including but not limited to: your local network, firewall, your internet service provider, the public internet, the public switched telephone network and your power supply. Skype takes no responsibility for any disruption, interruption or delay caused by any failure of or inadequacy in any of these items or any other items over which we have no control.\n\n5.10 Changes to Products:  Skype is constantly improving the Software and Products and may also need to change technical features from time to time in order to comply with applicable regulations. Accordingly, you acknowledge and agree that the Products and functionality of the Software may vary from time to time. Technical requirements for use of Products and Software and feature descriptions are available on the Skype Website. If you do not agree with any changes to Software and Products you may terminate your relationship with Skype in accordance with paragraph 11. You may need to upgrade to a new version in order to enjoy the benefit of certain Products. In addition, you acknowledge and agree that certain Products may be subject to usage limits or geographical restrictions, which may vary from time to time. Please check the Skype Website for details of the most up-to-date usage restrictions that apply to the Products that you are using. \n5.11 Unsolicited Ideas Skype does not consider or accept unsolicited proposals or ideas, including without limitation ideas for new products, technologies, promotions, product names, product feedback and product improvements (\u201cUnsolicited Feedback\u201d). If you send any Unsolicited Feedback to Skype through the Skype Website or otherwise, you acknowledge and agree that Skype shall not be under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to the Unsolicited Feedback.\n5.12 Reports Certain parts of the Skype Websites or the Software may ask for written suggestions or problem reports such as using our contact form or problem report form (\u201cReports\u201d). Please read carefully any specific terms, which govern those Reports. The Reports shall be deemed the property of Skype. Skype shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Reports throughout the universe in perpetuity and shall be entitled to use the Reports for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation to the provider of the Reports. Any Reports you send to Skype will not be treated as confidential and Skype shall not be liable for any disclosure of the Reports.\n5.13 Linking You may link to the Skype Website from another website owned by you, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it. You must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval or endorsement by Skype where none exists. You may not frame the Site on any other site. Skype provides a Qik branded embeddable flash player feature which you may incorporate into your own personal, non-commercial website for use in accessing the materials on the Qik branded Skype Website. Skype may revoke the permission to link to the Skype Websites at any time at its sole discretion and will notify you in this respect. \n   \n      \n    6. YOUR OBLIGATIONS \n   \n\n6.1 User Account. Prior to your first use of the Skype Software and your first use of the Qik Software, you will be asked to create a User Account and choose a user ID and password. We recommend that you choose a password that is hard to guess and consists of letters, numbers and symbols. You may only use the Software through your User Account. You are solely responsible and liable for all activities conducted through your User Account. To prevent unauthorized use, you shall keep your password confidential and shall not share it with any third party or use it to access third party websites or services. If you suspect that someone else knows your password, then you shall immediately change it in order to protect the security of your User Account. It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not respond to any unsolicited requests for credit card details, passwords or other data.  Skype takes no responsibility for your failure to comply with the obligations in this paragraph 6.1.\n6.2 Lawful Use: You must use the Software, Products and Skype Websites in accordance with the laws of where you are located. In some countries there are restrictions on the download and use of the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites. It is your responsibility to ensure that you are legally allowed to use the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites where you are located.\n6.3 Prohibited Use: You may not: \n(a) intercept or monitor, damage or modify any communication which is not intended for you; \n(b) use any type of spider, virus, worm, trojan-horse, time bomb or any other codes or instructions that are designed to distort, delete, damage, emulate or disassemble the Software, Products, Skype Websites, communication or protocols; \n(c) send unsolicited communications (also referred to as \u2018SPAM\u2019, \u2018SPIM\u2019 or \u2018SPIT\u2019) or any communication not permitted by applicable law or use the Software, Products or Skype Websites for the purposes of phishing or pharming or impersonating or misrepresenting affiliation with another person or entity; \n(d) expose any third party to material which is offensive, harmful to minors, indecent or otherwise objectionable in any way; \n(e) use the Software, Products or Skype Websites to cause or intend to cause embarrassment or distress to, or to threaten, harass or invade the privacy of, any third party; or \n(f) use (including as part of your User ID and/or profile picture) any material or content that is subject to any third party proprietary rights, unless you have a licence or permission from the owner of such rights; or \n(g) collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the Software, Products or Skype Websites;\n(h) impact or attempt to impact the availability of the Software, Products or Skype Websites for example, with a denial of service (DOS) or distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack;\n(i) use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, robots, spiders or offline readers that access the Software, Products or Skype Websites. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you agree that Skype grants to the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the Skype Website for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. Skype reserves the right to revoke these exceptions at any time.  \n6.4 User Submissions\nPlease exercise respect when participating in any features of the Skype Websites or Software such as Forums, Blogs, email functions, video hosting, sharing and/or publishing or any other function on the Skype Websites or of the Skype Software which allows you to post, upload, edit, host, share and/or publish content. You acknowledge and agree that: (i) by using the Skype Websites and/or Software you may be exposed to content that you may find offensive or indecent and you do so at your own risk; (ii) you are solely responsible for, and Skype has no responsibility to you or any third party for any User Submissions that you create, submit, post or publish on the Skype Websites or through the Software;  (iii) Skype does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to User Submissions, whether or not they are published (iv) Skype is not responsible for any User Submissions that you may have access to through your use of the Skype Websites or Software and all User Submissions are the responsibility of the person from whom such User Submissions originated. Skype does not endorse any User Submissions or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Submissions. \nIn connection with your User Submissions, you represent and warrant that you \n(i) own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize Skype to use all copyrights, trade marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property or proprietary rights in and to any and all User Submissions in accordance with these Terms; and \n(ii) you have the written consent, release and /or permission of each and every identifiable individual person in the User Submission to use the name and/or likeness of each and every such individual in the User Submission,  to enable inclusion and use thereof in the manner contemplated by these Terms.

Such Third Party Content may be protected by intellectual property laws and the owners of the intellectual property rights in such content may object to its use. You must not use any Third Party Content without first obtaining the permission of the owner of the intellectual property rights in such content.\nNotwithstanding any rights or obligations governed by the Additional Terms (as defined below) if, at any time you choose to upload or post User Submissions to the Skype Websites or through the Software (excluding Reports and excluding the content of your communications) you automatically grant Skype a non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free, perpetual, sub-licensable and transferable license of all rights to use, edit, modify, include, incorporate, adapt, record, publicly perform, display, transmit and reproduce the User Submissions including, without limitation, all trade marks associated therewith, in connection with the Skype Websites and Skype\u2019s Software and Products including for the purpose of promoting or redistributing part or all of the Skype Websites and/or the Software or Products,  in any and all media now known or hereafter devised.  You also hereby grant each user of the Skype Website and/or Skype\u2019s Software or Products a non-exclusive license to access your User Submission through the Skype Website and/or Software or Products and to use, copy, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, perform and transmit such User Submissions solely as permitted through the functionality of the Skype Websites and/or Software or Products and pursuant to these Terms of Use. In addition, you waive any so-called \u201cmoral rights\u201d in and to the User Submissions, to the extent permitted by applicable law.  \nYou may not submit or publish through the Skype Website or Software any User Submissions that are libelous, defamatory, pornographic, harassing, hateful, an invasion of privacy, obscene, abusive, illegal, racist, offensive, harmful to a minor or an infringement of any intellectual property rights or a trade secret of a third party, or would otherwise violate the rights of any third party or give rise to civil or criminal liability. Furthermore, you may not submit or publish User Submissions that contain falsehoods or mispresentations, solicit funds or services, contain advertising, promotional materials, junk mail, spam, chain letters or any form of solicitation, impersonate others or include programs that contain viruses or any other programs designed to impair the functionality of any computer. You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the Skype Website or Software with respect to their User Submissions. You agree not to circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with the security related features of the Skype Website or Software or features that prevent or restrict the use of any content thereof.\n\n6.5 Your Information: From time to time, Skype may request information from you for the purpose of supplying the Software or Products to you. You shall ensure that any such information is complete, up-to-date and accurate. \n6.6 No Reselling. The Software and Products are for your individual use. You shall not resell or commercialise the Software and/or Products to any third party.\n6.7 Export Restrictions:  The Software may be subject to international rules that govern the export of software.  You shall comply with all applicable international and national laws that apply to the Software as well as end-user, end-use, destination restrictions issued by national governments or similar bodies, and restrictions on embargoed nations. In the US the Internet Communications Software is controlled under ECCN 5D992 of the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d) under Encryption Registration Number (\u201cERN\u201d) R100351and thus may not be exported or re exported from the US to or downloaded by any person in any countries controlled for anti terrorism reasons under the EAR, which include Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Syria and Sudan. Moreover, the Internet Communications Software may not be exported or re exported from the US to or downloaded by any person or entity subject to US sanctions regardless of location. See www.bis.doc.gov/ComplianceAndEnforcement/ListsToCheck.htm and EAR Part 736. Skype is making the Software available to you for download only on the condition that you certify that you are not such a person or entity and that the download is not otherwise in violation of US export control and sanctions regulations. \n   \n      \n    7.

CHARGES \n    \n   \n    8.1 Calling phones and premium rate numbers with Skype Credit: \n    \n (i) Calling landlines and mobiles: The charges payable for calling phones (outside of a subscription) consist of a connection fee (charged once, per call) and a per-minute rate as set out on  www.skype.com/go/allrates. All calls will be disconnected and require a re-dial after a 4-hour duration and an additional connection fee will be charged on re-dial.  \n  (ii)  Premium rate numbers: The charges payable for calling premium rate numbers consist of a per-minute rate available at  www.skype.com/go/rates-premium. No connection fee is payable.  \n  (iii) Skype may change the rates for calling phones and premium rate numbers at any time without notice to you by posting such change at  www.skype.com/go/allrates. The new rate will apply to your next purchase after the new rates have been published. Please check the latest rates before you make your call. If you do not accept the new rates, do not make your call.  \n(iv) The duration of a call shall be based on one-minute increments. Fractions of minutes will be rounded up to the next minute. The connection fee, where applicable, will be charged at the beginning of the call. At the end of a call, fractional cent charges will be rounded up to the nearest whole cent, for example a total call price of \u20ac0.034 will be rounded up to \u20ac0.04. During the call, charges incurred will be deducted automatically from the Skype Credit balance in your User Account.\n  \n    8.2 Charges for other Paid For Products: The charges for other Paid For Products will be confirmed to you before you complete a purchase from Skype. Skype may change the charges payable for the purchase of such Products at any time without any notice to you. You can choose whether or not to accept the new charges prior to completing your next purchase of the applicable Product. The new charges will apply to your next purchase after the new charges have been published. \n    \n   \n    8.3 Promotional Offers: From time to time, Skype may offer Paid-For Products for free for a trial period. Skype reserves the right to charge you for such Products (at the normal rate) in the event that Skype determines (in its reasonable discretion) that you are abusing the terms of the offer, including if you are using any service, proxy or other devices or anonymous IP address that prevents us from locating you.    \n  \n \n   8.4 Tax: 15% Luxembourg VAT generally applies if you are located in the EU and if you don\u2019t have a VAT registration number. Skype reserves the right to apply VAT at the appropriate rate as per VAT rules applicable at the time of purchase. 8% Swiss VAT applies if you are located in Switzerland. Other local taxes may apply in certain countries. If you are located in the EU and if you have a VAT registration number, you are liable to self-assess VAT in your country at the appropriate rate as per the reverse charge rules applicable in your country. When you purchase a voucher or pre-paid card, depending on the country, 15% Luxembourg VAT, local VAT or other taxes may apply and may be deducted from the value of the voucher or prepaid card upon redemption. Your Skype Credit balance is displayed exclusive of any such taxes.  The territories in the EU set out below are outside the scope of EU VAT under Council Directive 2006/112/EC on the common system of VAT, as amended. The Skype Website does not enable users in such territories to take advantage of this VAT exemption and we therefore do not provide the Products in such territories: Mount Athos, Canary Islands, French Overseas Departments, Aland Islands, Channel Islands, Heligoland Island, Busingen Territory, Ceuta, Melilla, Levigno, Campioned'Italia and Italian Waters of Lake Lugano.  \n \n  \n    \n    8.5 Third Party Charges: Using the Software on mobile applications will use some of the data allowance available on the data package to which you have subscribed with your mobile network operator.  Out-of-country usage may lead to significantly higher costs than regular usage, and you are solely responsible for keeping yourself informed and paying for possible roaming and other applicable charges levied by your mobile network operator.\n   \n  \n \n \n    \n      \n    9. PAYMENT \n    \n   \n    9.1 Skype Credit.  You can pay for select Paid-For Products using Skype Credit. You can purchase Skype Credit using any payment method made available to you by Skype from time to time. The Skype Credit that you purchase will be credited to your User Account at the time of purchase (or if you are using a Skype Credit voucher, at the time you redeem that voucher).\n    \n  \n    9.2 Inactive Skype Credit. If you do not use your Skype Credit for a period of 180 days, (including Skype Credit that has been allocated to you by a Skype Manager administrator) Skype will place your Skype Credit on inactive status.  You can reactivate the Skype Credit by following the reactivation link in My Account at  https://secure.skype.com/account/credit-reactivate.   Reactivated Skype Credit is not refundable. If you are located in Japan and you buy Skype Credit from the Skype Website, this paragraph does not apply to you and your Skype Credit shall expire 6 months from the date of purchase. You are not permitted to use any Skype Credit on or after the date of its expiry.\n    \n   \n    9.3 Other payment methods. Skype does not guarantee that you will be able to use your Skype Credit balance to purchase all Products. Where Skype Credit cannot be used to pay for a Product, Skype will make another payment method available to you. Skype reserves the right to remove or amend the available payment methods at its sole discretion.\n    \n  \n   \n    9.4 Recurring Payments. Where you purchase Products on a subscription basis (monthly, every 3 months or annually (as applicable)), you acknowledge and agree that this is a recurring payment and payments shall be made to Skype by the method you have chosen at the recurring intervals chosen by you, until the subscription for that Product is terminated by you or by Skype.\n   \n  \n   \n    9.5 Auto-Recharge. \n  \n  (a) The Auto-Recharge feature will be automatically enabled when you buy Skype Credit, unless you untick the appropriate box.  Your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the same amount and by the same payment method chosen when you first sign up for Auto-Recharge, unless you subsequently change the amount by accessing your User Account. For example, if you purchase 10 Euros of Skype Credit with your credit card, the recharge amount charged to your credit card will also be 10 Euros of Skype Credit.  In future the same amount will be charged to your credit card every time your Skype account balance goes below the threshold set by Skype from time to time.   If you do not want to enable Auto-Recharge, please untick the box.   \n  (b) If you purchased a subscription with a payment method other than credit card, PayPal or Moneybookers (Skrill), and you have enabled Auto-Recharge, your Skype Credit balance will be recharged with the amount necessary to purchase your next recurring subscription. \n  (c) You can disable Auto-Recharge at any time by accessing your User Account. \n   \n     \n   10. REFUND POLICY \n   \n  \n   10.1  When you purchase Paid-For-Products directly from Skype you will be entitled to a cancellation period of fifteen (15) days (a \u201cCooling-Off Period\u201d) unless you have made use of the Paid-For-Products in any way, in which case the Cooling-Off Period will be extinguished and your purchase cannot be cancelled or refunded. \n   \n  \n   10.2  Outside of the Cooling-Off Period, only subscriptions are refundable unless used or expired.\n \n  \n   10.3  Expenditure of Skype Credit, allocation of an Online Number, or use of any aspect of a subscription amounts to \u201cuse\u201d of a Paid-For-Product. You hereby expressly agree that Online Numbers may be allocated before the end of the Cooling-Off Period.\n \n  \n   10.4  The Cooling-Off Period and refunds do not apply to Paid-For-Products that are (i) purchased via a third party partner of Skype (please contact the partner directly, who may decide in its sole discretion whether or not to pay a refund), (ii) not directly acquired online from Skype (e.g. vouchers or pre-paid cards) (iii) paid for in cash using third party payment methods (such as a cash payment wallet) and (iv) paid for and allocated to your Skype Account by a Skype Manager administrator. They also do not apply to Membership of Skype Developer.\n \n  \n   10.5  If you believe that Skype has charged you in error, you must contact Skype within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges which are more than 90 days old.\n \n  \n   10.6  Skype reserves the right to refuse a refund request if it reasonably believes (i) that you are trying to unfairly exploit this refund policy, for example, by making repetitive refund requests in respect of the same Product; (ii) if you are in breach of these Terms or (iii) if Skype reasonably suspects that you are using our Products or Software fraudulently or that your User Account is being used by a third party fraudulently. \n \n  \n   10.7  This refund policy does not affect your statutory rights. \n \n   \n      \n    11. ENDING YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SKYPE \n    \n  11.1 You may terminate your relationship with Skype at any time and without recourse to the courts by requesting closure of your User Account, ceasing to use the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites and cancelling any recurring payments.   \n  11.2 Skype may terminate its relationship with you, or may terminate or suspend your use of the Software, User Account(s), Products or Skype Websites at any time and without recourse to the courts:   \n  (a) if you are in breach of these Terms;\n  (b) if Skype reasonably suspects that you are using the Software, the Products and/or Skype Websites to break the law or infringe third party rights;  \n  (c) if Skype reasonably suspects that you are trying to unfairly exploit or misuse the refund policy, or any of our policies.  \n  (d) if Skype reasonably suspects that you are using our Products, Software and/or Skype Websites fraudulently or that your User Account is being used by a third party fraudulently; \n  (e) if you have purchased Skype Credit from an unauthorised reseller;  \n  (f) in respect of a particular Product, on thirty (30) days notice if Skype decides to cease offering that Product; \n  (g) immediately, if required due to a change in laws/regulation by a regulator or authority with a lawful mandate, or by any of Skype\u2019s partners; \n  (h) on thirty (30) days notice if Skype decides to cease offering the Software to users in your jurisdiction generally.  \n   11.3 Skype shall effect such termination by preventing your access to your User Account, the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites (as applicable). We reserve the right to cancel User Accounts that have been inactive for more than one (1) year.\n   11.4 Consequences of Termination: Upon termination of your relationship with Skype: (a) all licenses and rights to use the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites shall immediately terminate; (b) you will immediately cease any and all use of the Software, Products and/or Skype Websites; and (c) you will immediately remove the Software from all hard drives, networks and other storage media and destroy all copies of the Software in your possession or under your control.  \n\n     \n   \n      \n    12.

Where we provide you with an Online Number or Skype To Go number, you agree that: \n  \n   \n  you do not own the number or have a right to retain that number forever; \n   \tthe number provided to you is subject to applicable numbering rules and regulatory practices;\n   \t you will comply on an ongoing basis with any specific number allocation requirements that we make you aware of, or any reasonable instructions that Skype or Skype\u2019s partners may give to you with regard to the use of the numbers and the Products;\n   \tyou will not transfer or attempt to transfer your number to any third party.

At Skype, we want all of our customers to get the best calling plans, known as \u2018subscriptions\u2019, at the lowest possible price. This Fair Usage Policy (\"FUP\") is designed to prevent fraud and abuse of our subscriptions by a small number of users.\nSubject to this FUP, Skype\u2019s unlimited subscriptions allow unlimited calls to landlines in the applicable subscription countries (excluding special, premium, service and non-geographic numbers). Unlimited calls to mobiles may also be included where stated at the time of purchase. All calls will be disconnected and require a re-dial after a 2-hour duration. \nSkype\u2019s subscriptions are for individual use only (personal or business communications) in accordance with our Terms of Use and this FUP (\u201cLegitimate Use\u201d). The following is a non-exhaustive list of practices that would not be considered Legitimate Use:\n\nUsing subscriptions for telemarketing or call centre operations;\n \tRe-selling subscription minutes;\n \tSharing subscriptions between users whether via a PBX, call centre, computer or any other means;\n \tCalling numbers (whether singly, sequentially or automatically) to generate income for yourself or others as a result of merely placing the call, other than for your individual business communications (and subject to Section 4.1 of the Terms of Use); and\n \tUnusual calling patterns inconsistent with normal, individual subscription use, for example, regular calls of short duration or calls to multiple numbers in a short period of time.\nOther practices may be relevant in determining Legitimate Use and Skype reserves the right to take any unlawful, prohibited, abnormal or unusual activity into account in making its determination. Skype may at its option, terminate its relationship with you, or may suspend your subscription immediately if it determines you are using your subscription contrary to this FUP or Skype\u2019s Terms of Use. Where reasonable, Skype will provide you with notice of improper usage before suspension or termination of your subscription and, if appropriate, Skype may offer you an alternative subscription.\n\n (b) Skype reserves the right to withdraw or change the subscriptions at any time. If Skype changes the Products included in your subscription, Skype will notify you by email stating the changes and their effective date.  If you do not wish to accept these changes, you are entitled to terminate your subscription, with effect from the date on which the changes are due to take effect.   \n (c) The \u2018Unlimited World Extra\u2019 subscription has a minimum fixed term of 2 years from the date of purchase. You are not permitted to terminate it before the expiry of the 2-year minimum term except in case of breach by Skype of the Terms. This subscription is billed monthly as a recurring payment. \n\n     19.4 Spinvox for Skype\n    The maximum number of characters per SMS is 153 and no more than 3 SMS messages will be delivered per voicemail. You will be charged for each SMS sent as a result of a recorded voicemail, regardless of whether or not the caller leaves a message. We reserve the right to charge for any undelivered SMS message that we have been unable to convert from voicemail due to reasons beyond Skype's control. Only voicemails in English, French, German and Spanish will be converted to text.  \n\n   19.5 Skype WiFi \nSkype WiFi is provided by one of Skype\u2019s WiFi partners. Your use of Skype WiFi is subject to that partner\u2019s terms of service. Before you start a Skype WiFi session at a specific WiFi hotspot, you will be notified of the identity of the WiFi provider and their terms of service. You will have to read their terms of service, which you agree to be subject to by proceeding with the Skype WiFi session.
