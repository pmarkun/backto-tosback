TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit\nwhose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet\nby promoting principles of disclosure and informed consent. Because\nCare2 wants to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have\nagreed\nto disclose our information practices and have our privacy practices\nreviewed and audited for compliance by TRUSTe.\n\nThe TRUSTe program covers information that is collected through this Web site (care2.com).\nThe TRUSTe program does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.\n\nWhen visiting a website displaying the TRUSTe Trustmark, you will\nbe notified of what personally identifiable information of yours is\ncollected:\n\n\nThe organization collecting the information;\n\nHow the information is used;\n\nWith whom the information may be shared;\n\nWhat choices are available to you regarding collection, use and\n  distribution of the information;\n\nThe kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the\n  loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company's\ncontrol;\n\nAnd how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.\n\n\n       Questions regarding this privacy statement should be submitted to Care2\nCustomer Support using the Help Form.\nIf Care2 has not responded to your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, please contact\n       TRUSTe.\nhttp://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php\n\n\n\nPrivacy Questions\n\n\n\n\nDoes Care2 ask for personal information?\n\n\n\n\nHow does Care2 use my personal information?\n\n\n\n\nShould I post personal information in group forums?\n\n\n\n\nWill Care2 disclose any of my personal information?\n\n\n\n\nHow do I change my personal information?\n\n\n\n\nWhat is heightened security?\n\n\n\n\nWill Care2 use my information for direct e-mailings?\n\n\n\n\nDoes Care2 use cookies?\n\n\n\n\nWhat tracking technologies does Care2 use?\n\n\n\n\nDoes Care2 sell e-mail addresses to advertisers?\n\n\n\n\nHow does Care2 secure its data storage?\n\n\n\n\nData Retention Policy\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the privacy standards for Care2's marketplace partners and affiliates?\n\n\n\nWhat else should I know about my privacy?\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if changes are made to the privacy policy?\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information...\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nAnswers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Care2 ask for personal information?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes. Care2 asks for your name and other personal information when you\nsign up for our services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Does Care2 use my personal information?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersonal and Demographic Information:\n\nCare2 asks for personal\n  information, such as your name, email address, street address and zip code. Your\n  personal information is used to set up your Care2 account and to\nallow you to use many Care2 member services. Members may also supply\nadditional information for special site services such as My Care2 and Biorhythms.\nCare2 may also ask for demographic information,\nsuch as your education level, occupation and industry. Care2 does not knowingly\ncollect information from children under 13 and if Care2 later learns that a\nchild under 13 is registered, steps will be taken to remove the child's\ninformation from the data base.\n\n\n\n\nAdvertising:\n\nCare2's goal in collecting personal and demographic\n  information is to provide our members with the most personalized\nweb experience possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to\n  reach the right audience. By knowing about you, Care2 can deliver\n  more relevant content and advertisements (e.g. banner ads), and\nhence better service, to you.\n\n\nIn delivering targeted online advertisements, Care2 plays the middleman.\n    Advertisers give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they\n    want to reach (e.g. females over 35). Care2 or one of our ad\nserver partners takes and displays the ad to users meeting those\ncriteria.  In this process, only Care2 -- not the advertiser can access\nindividuals' account information.\n\n\n\nWe use third-party advertising companies to serve some of the ads\n    when you visit our web site. These companies may use information\n    (not including your name, address, email or telephone number)\nabout your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide\nadvertisements\n    on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest\n    to you. In the course of serving advertisements on Care2.com, our\n    third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique\n\"cookie\"\n    on your browser. If you would like more information about this\npractice\n    and to know your choices about not having this information use by\n    these companies,\n\nclick here.  Advertisers may also use \"clear gifs\" to track advertising page views, but\nthis information is not connected to personal information collected by Care2.\n\n\n\nAdvertising revenues help keep Care2 services free, and provide\n    revenues for donations for wildlife conservation and other charities.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiorhythm Generator:\n\n\nThe biorhythm generator is a Care2 feature that plots graph results of an\nindividual's intellectual, physical and emotional biorhythm cycles based on the\nindividual's birth date. To use the feature, users enter their birth date and\nthe date for which they wish to view results. This information is only used for\nthe Biorhythm feature. The graph results are intended to inform and entertain.\nCare2 does not share or disclose the birth date or graph information with any\nother party and is used only for immediate display for the person entering\nhis/her information.\n\n\n\nPetitionSite:\nCare2 owns and maintains the nonpartisan PetitionSite.com.  Petition and Public\nComment signers are required to provide certain personal information such as\nname, email address and often street address. This information is required to\nvalidate the petition / public comment. Care2 uses cookies and a signature\ndatabase to provide data integrity and ease of use.\n\nFor petitions and surveys you've signed or completed, we treat your name, city,\nstate, country and comments as public information\u0097for example, we may provide\ncompilations of petitions, with your comments, to the President and\nlegislators, other targets, or to the press.  Unless you have requested to be\nshown as 'anonymous,' this information will also be visible on the website. We\nwill not make your street address publicly available, but we may transmit it to\nmembers of Congress, to other public officials, or to other targets as part of\na petition to validate your signature. We may also make your comments, along\nwith your first name, city, state and country, available to the press and\npublic online.\n\nCare2 hosts two kinds of petitions:  free petitions sponsored by individuals\nand petitions sponsored by nonprofits.\n\nFor the free petitions, only the public information listed above is made\navailable to the petition sponsors or targets.\n\nFor many of the petitions sponsored by nonprofits,\nwe provide an advocacy service allowing individuals to send individual e-mails\nto public officials, legislators, and other targets as well as public comments\nto government agencies, through our website. These messages are sent in your\nname, with your e-mail address as the return address and your full name and\ncontact information is provided as part of the submission. These messages will\nonly be sent out under your name as you approve them on an individual basis by\nsigning an action. You are solely responsible for the specific message(s) you\nsend using our email tool.  Optional comments will be included in the body of\nthe email message delivered to the petition target.\n\nDuring the signing process, you may opt to receive certain newsletters and memberships,\nin which case Care2 will send your contact information to those 3rd party providers.\nHowever, unless you specifically opt to receive such offers or send your contact\ninformation to 3rd parties during the signing process, Care2 will keep your email\naddress information confidential.\n\n\n\n\n\nCare2 Caf\u00e9 Discussions:\n\n\nTo post messages to the Care2 Caf\u00e9 discussion boards, users must be Care2\nmembers and must log in. When posting a message, a member's Care2 name and/or user name will\nappear hyperlinked as the \"author\" of each message. Login is required to\nensure that every user who posts a message has a unique user id. The name\nis hyperlinked to allow other Care2 users to e-mail you; our system is designed\nto allow members to contact you via e-mail without revealing your e-mail\naddress. When posting a message, there is an e-mail notification check off box\nthat is automatically checked off so that you will be notified via e-mail when\nanother user responds to your posted message. If you do not want to receive\nthese e-mail notifications, simply uncheck the e-mail notification box before\nposting your message. After posting a message, a link to your member profile\nwill appear (if you have submitted a member profile). Because, your discussion\npostings and member profile will be publicly available, Do NOT include\npersonal information.\n\n\n\n\nE-Cards:\n\n\nWhen sending e-cards, Care2 requires your email address and the name and email address of the intended e-card\nrecipient. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not share or sell the e-mail addresses entered by card senders.\n\n\n\nE-Mail:\n\nTo provide Care2 members email service, Care2 sends its email service provider, MailCentro, Inc., your first and last name, user\nname,  Care2 email address, and an encrypted password that serves as a\nproxy for your actual password (Care2 does not relinquish your actual\npassword, except on rare occasion as required to provide customer support to an\nindividual). MailCentro does not use the user's information for any other\npurpose than to set up and maintain the email account.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletters\n\nCare2 offers a variety of Care2 and 3rd party newsletters.  If you opt to\nreceive one or more newsletters via a check box, submit button or by clicking on a specially\nmarked subscribe link, Care2 will send any required contact information to\nthose 3rd party providers.\n\n\n\n\nCare2 Connect:\n\nCare2 Connect (C2C) is an optional part of Care2 that facilitates new connections between members. C2C is accessible only among Care2 members who have personal profiles.  Your personal contact information such as your email address and street address will be kept hidden from the public, and made visible only to you and individuals you have indicated are your friends.   The C2C directory helps members locate their friends, and potential friends, by displaying first name, last name, city and other information on search results - but it does not include contact information per the aforementioned limitations. Contact can be initiated for \"non-friends\" by using an anonymous messaging system that will not reveal either party's address.\n\nWhen submitting a profile, you have the option of including information such as: your name, city, state, and country of residence, birthdate, gender, hobbies, interests, expertises, occupation, business, homepage url, email address, marital status, marital status, personal quote, photos, etc.  Remember: Because, much of this information will be publicly available, do NOT include confidential information.   Your personal friends network will be populated based on known relationships you have with other C2C members, as established through use of communications services on the Care2 system and as you specifically indicate while using C2C. Your friends network will be visible to other C2C users, and the privacy of each person is protected as described herein.\n\nTell-a-Friend service: Care2 Connect members can elect to invite friends to join using an invitation template provided by Care2. Through the template, one e-mail invitation containing a unique url link is sent to each person whose email is\nentered by the sender. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not collect or\nsell the e-mail addresses entered by Care2 members.\n\nMembers can remove themselves from the C2C system at any time by adjusting their account settings via their My Account Page. Some changes may take up to 24 hours to appear on the site.\n\n\n\n\n\nRace for the Rain Forest\n\n\n,\n\n\nRace for the Big Cats\n\n\n,\n\n\nRace for the Primates\n\n\n,\n\n\nRace for the Pets in Need\n\n\n,\n\n\nRace for the Oceans\n\n\nand\n\n\nEnd Breast Cancer\n\n\n: Members and visitors may participate in the click-to-donate Races without entering personal\ninformation. However, to track visits and see how one compares to other Race\nparticipants, members must be logged in while visiting the Race. Care2 members are automatically\nregistered for each race the first time they click on the free donation button while logged-in. New visitors can become Race participants after\nregistering for a Care2 account.\n\nWhen Race participants login to a Race, Care2 tracks the participant's site\nvisits. Race participants can elect to invite friends to join the Races using an invitation template provided by Care2. Through the template, one e-mail invitation containing a unique url link to the Race is sent to each person whose email is\nentered by the sender. Care2 has a no-SPAM policy and thus will not collect or\nsell the e-mail addresses entered by Race participants. All Race participants\nwill also receive periodic Race updates via e-mail. These updates can be\ndisabled using the \"account settings\" page on the Race web site.\n\nIf a friend joins a Race using an invitation url, Care2 records the friend relationship and gives credit to the friend's \"upline\" for each click.  Sending the url in personal e-mails or posting it in text or image-link format is entirely the member's option, although Care2\nspecifically asks members to avoid sending the unique url to anyone they do not\nknow. Players' participation data is aggregated daily and the participation\nstatistics of the top 100 Racers are posted more frequently on each race.\n\n\nDistributed Services: Care2 provides 3rd party affiliates access via service modules to certain content and services on the Care2 site. These modules may include discussion boards, user submitted content and other services.  The modules may be embedded to appear as if they are part of the 3rd party websites, though the modules themselves are hosted on Care2 servers. All feeds and service modules are subject to our Affiliate Terms of Service. The goal for these distribution services is to expand Care2's network reach to engage more like-minded individuals.  \nRSS Feeds: Care2 makes some content on our site available as RSS feeds. Content available for syndication is usually denoted with an XML or RSS button. All content syndicated is subject to our Terms of Service. No modifications may be made to any of the materials syndicated. No individual, organization or company may license, sell or otherwise assign use of Care2 RSS content.   RSS distribution services help Care2 and its members reach and engage more like-minded individuals.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould I post personal information in group forums?\n\n\n\n\nUsers should always be aware that any personally identifiable information submitted to Care2.com can be read, collected, and used by other users of the Care2 site, and could be used to send unsolicited messages to the submitter. Care2 is not responsible for personally identifiable information which users choose to submit. Care2 specifically advises users not to provide information which they regard as sensitive, such as email addresses, phone numbers, mailing addresses, or financial information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill Care2 disclose any of my personal information?\n\n\n\n\nCare2 will only disclose your personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or\nproperty of Care2, or as necessary to provide personalized Care2 member services.  Care2 may also disclose your personal information, including name and contact information in some limited circumstances such as when you specifically opt to receive a 3rd party newsletter.  We may also provide information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Care2 under confidentiality agreements.  These companies may use your personal information to communicate with you about offers from Care2 and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.\nUnder confidentiality agreements, Care2 may also match user information with\nthird-party data.  Also, Care2 does disclose aggregated\nuser statistics (for example, X% of our users are female) in order to\ndescribe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other\nthird parties, and for other lawful purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I change my personal information?\n\n\n\nTo make changes to your name, password, address, subscriptions and other account information, simply log\nin to your account and click on the \"\n\nMy Account\n\"\nlink. Select the appropriate function(s) to make your desired\nchange(s).\nFor other changes to your account, please send an email, using our Help Form detailing the changes you wish to make to your account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is \"Heightened Security\"?\n\n\n\nFor your convenience, we provide a way for you to recover a lost password or user name via a webpage.  The \"\nheightened security\" option is an account management tool that disables that recovery feature. If you enable heightened security, no one (including yourself) can search for your login information and view it online.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWill Care2 use my information for direct e-mailings?\n\n\n\nCare2 offers a variety of direct e-mail subscriptions describing our\nsite progress, new features, healthy living tips, activist alerts,\nnews and announcements including commercial and non-commercial offers.\nIf you do not want to receive any of our optional mailings, simply opt\nout of them when registering to become a member or during other\nsubscription opportunities. If you sign a petition on our\nPetitionSite.com, you will automatically receive updates on the\npetition and other important causes. If you elect to receive a\nnewsletter but later change your mind, go to your My Account page and\nchange your Subscription preferences to unsubscribe from the\nnewsletter. Each emailing will also contain unsubscription information\nin the email footer. Regardless of the above, Care2 may send\noccasional important updates regarding a member's account, critical\nservice announcements, and other correspondence to all registered\nmembers. To stop all such announcements, you must delete your account.\nYou may do so by following\nthis link\nto verify your identity.\nCare2 also offers optional mailings from our partner nonprofit\norganizations and from commercial entities. If you elect to receive\nany of these newsletters, some personal information including your\nname and contact information will be sent to the respective nonprofit\nor commercial entity delivering the newsletter. The user should beware\nthat by opting-in to either the nonprofit or commercial newsletter\nofferings, Care2 will no longer be able to track and control the user\ninformation sent out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Care2 use cookies?\n\n\n\n\n\nYes,\n\ncookies are used on Care2 in two ways.\n\n\n(1) We use cookies to be reminded of whom you are and to access your\naccount information (stored on our computers) to deliver a better and\nmore personalized service to you.\n\n\n(2) Advertising networks serving ads onto Care2 may also use cookies.\nCare2 has no control over information collected by advertising\nnetworks\nnor can we access this information.\n\n\nYour browser cookie may expire when you end your session or may persist, depending on your login \"remember me\" settings. We may also, from time to time, log visitor activity across the web site on our web server system logs. If you elect to disable cookies on web browser you may be unable\nto use certain Care2 site features that require membership, such as accessing your email account, viewing\nmember profiles, and changing your user preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat tracking technologies does Care2 use?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to cookies (see above), Care2 tracks information via database\nrecords and \"clear gifs\" that allow Care2 to know if a web page has been\nviewed.\n\nIf you elect to disable cookies on your hard drive, this will also disable\ndatabase tracking of personalized statistics such as click-to-donate race\nclicks, and you may be unable to use certain Care2 site features that require\nyour user name, such as accessing your email account, viewing member profiles,\nand changing your user preferences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Care2 sell e-mail addresses to advertisers?\n\n\n\n\n\nNot without your direct permission. We respect your privacy and despise\nSPAM.\n\n\nAs mentioned above, in some cases you may opt to receive nonprofit partner\nnewsletters or other commercial offers.   When you opt to receive such an offer via Care2, we\nwill send your email address and other necessary contact information to the\nnewsletter publisher.  Depending on the newsletter, this may result in a fee\npaid to Care2 in exchange for a new customer.  Care2 will never offer\nnewsletter subscriptions from, or reveal your address information to,\norganizations known to be spammers, casinos, or adult-content providers.\n\n\nWhy then do some people receive spam at an account they have only used on Care2? Either the spammer did \"random combinations\" of letters/numbers to guess the address, the member sent someone an email message that somehow got distributed, or perhaps someone entered their address by mistake somewhere else. Bottom line, if it came from a known spammer, we had nothing to do with it - spam is bad, we hate it, and we would never associate ourselves with spammers.\n\n\n\nWith regards to e-mail communication with us, we read every message\nsent to us and do our best to respond quickly. We do save messages\nthat\nmight be needed if the sender contacts us again, but we absolutely do\nnot sell or rent e-mail addresses to other companies, unless you have\nspecifically opted to receive such communications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow does Care2 secure its data storage?\n\n\n\nCare2's servers are located at a world-class co-location facility in\nCalifornia, USA.  The facility has some of the most powerful physical security\nsystems in the business, from advanced smoke detection and fire suppression\nsystems to 24/7 secured access with motion sensors, video camera surveillance,\nand security breach alarms.  Only certain Care2 employees are given access to\nthe building.  Access to the database is protected by a firewall and secure\ndata lines and available only to certain Care2 employees on an as-necessary\nbasis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Retention Policy\n\n\n\nOur data retention policy varies depending on the business and system needs, but remains in harmony with the other policies stated here.\nOur business systems and databases are securely stored and archived for disaster recovery purposes. Petition signatures are only retained\nin our databases for a 90 day period. Personal Messages in a members \"SAVE\" folder are retained indefinitely, while the remaining personal\nmessages that have been read but not saved are purged after 2 years. Photos uploaded for sharing are resized for web display only and original larger images removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the privacy standards for Care2's marketplace partners and affiliates?\n\n\n\nCare2 has entered into affiliate relationships with leading companies in retail and services. You will find these companies listed on the Care2 Shopping pages. Care2 visitors who visit these partners from the Care2 web site generate donations from their purchases that in turn support worthy causes. Care2 does not share your personal information with affiliate programs; your purchases with them are alone sufficient to generate donations.\n\nCare2's Privacy Policy does not extend to transactions you may enter into with affiliates or partners. Care2 partners and third-party Internet sites and services accessible through Care2 have separate, independent privacy and data collection practices. Care2 has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat else should I know about my privacy?\n\n\n\nPlease keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, Care2 Groups, or  in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others.   In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly\naccessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Furthermore, while we strive to protect your personal information, Care2 cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us over the Internet, and you do so at your own risk. In addition, Care2 partners and third-party Internet sites and services accessible through Care2 have separate, independent privacy and data collection practices. Care2 has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or\nactions. The point? You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of\nyour passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and\nresponsible whenever you're online.\n\n\nAlso, Care2 uses reputable third parties to serve some of the advertisements\nthat you see on the pages of Care2. These companies may use\ninformation about\nyour visits to this and other web sites in order to provide\nadvertisements\non this site and other sites about goods and services of interest to\nyou. If you would like more information about this practice and to\nknow\nyour choices about not having this information used by these\ncompanies,\nplease\n\nclick\nhere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if changes are made to the privacy policy?\n\n\n\n\nCare2 reserves the right to change the privacy policy but will notify\nusers of such changes through email and/or by posting a notice on the\nsite. If the change involves the use of a user's personally\nidentifiable information then the notice to users will contain directions\non how users can opt-out of the change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information...\n\n\n\n\n\nElectronic Frontier Foundation\n\n  - a civil liberties organization working to protect your rights\non-line. \n\n\nElectronic Privacy Information Center\n\n  - established to focus public attention on emerging civil liberties\n  issues relating to the National Information Infrastructure. \n\n       \n\nCare2 Customer Support\n  Care2 attempts to respond to all inquiries within 48 hours. \n       \n\nReport Spam Abuse\n  \n\nCare2.com, Inc.\n275 Shoreline Drive, Suite 300\nRedwood City, CA 94065\nPhone: 650-622-0860\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
