Our reputation and integrity is directly related to how we serve you, our readers, and protect your privacy.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information may include: the IP address of the server your computer is logged into, your browser type, your screen resolution setting, the Web pages you visited, which ads have been displayed and whether you responded to any ads delivered by PJM. Email addresses may or may not include PII. For example you might have your first and last name, or even your first and last name and city in your email address, or you might have an email address that is associated with a URL and website that contains PII. In those cases your email address would include PII. However, not all email addresses contain, or can be linked to PII.\nNon-Personally Identifiable Information\nApplicability of Policy\nIn order to bring you offers that may be of interest to you, we have relationships with other companies that we allow to place ads on our Web pages.\nInformation Collected\nPJM does not obtain any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address, when you visit PJM or read any articles contained on our site.
