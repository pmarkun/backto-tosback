This helps us to recognize you, customize or personalize your shopping experience and store items in your cart between visits. It also allows us to aggregate demographic and statistical data and compilations of information that do not include personal information and provide this information to our partners and service providers. By doing so, we hope to understand our customers' needs so that we can provide them with new products and services or tailor existing products and services to fit their needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclosing Personal Information\nWhen processing your information, we may disclose personal information to our related companies and third parties for purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.
