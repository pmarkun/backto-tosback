We may use this information in the following ways:\n\t\t\t    When you provide your information to one of Brown Shoe Company, Inc.\u2019s websites, we may share that information with one or more of our other websites.\n\t\t\t    In order to streamline your shopping experience, we recommend that you complete our registration form. During registration you are required to give personal contact information (such as name and email address). By registering your account information, you are able to take advantage of special offers and e-mails about new promotions, fashion trends, site and service announcement updates, etc. It is also more convenient for a registered customer to make purchases online. We do not share your registration information with outside parties.\n\t\t\t    On the order form, you must provide contact information (such as name, billing address and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). We use this information for billing purposes and to fill customer orders.  If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this contact information to get in touch with you.\n\t\t\t    If you elect to refer a friend to our website, we ask you for your name and email address and your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send the friend an email inviting him or her to view your selected items on the website.  We use this information for the sole purpose of sending this email.\n\t\t\t    The personal information you provide may be combined with other personally identifiable information (such as demographic information and past purchase information) available from Brown Shoe Company, Inc., records and other sources.

Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. We may share this information with our service providers who perform services such as gathering survey data or facilitating contests on our behalf, but we do not authorize these providers to disclose or use your information for any other purpose. \n\t\t\t    Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to not receive information on products, services and special promotions.

If you no longer wish to receive our promotional materials, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by using the unsubscribe option at the bottom of any email communication you receive or by clicking here.\nCookies\n\t\t      A cookie is a short string of data that lets our website remember who you are, serving much like a unique membership ID.

When you leave our site, we terminate our interaction with the cookie.  The cookie stays on your computer, and you can delete it anytime you'd like, but that means that you'd need to login again and re-enter any preferences you have set.\n\nLog Files\n                We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users\u2019 movements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.\n                \nInformation Shared with Third PartiesShipping, Billing and Other Service Companies\n                We use outside shipping companies to ship orders and mail catalogs and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. We may partner with other parties from time to time to provide specific services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.\n                \nAdvertising\n                We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet and sometimes on this website.
