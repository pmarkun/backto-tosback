Changes to the policy shall not apply retroactively.\n\n\t\tInformation received and stored by the White House when you visit WhiteHouse.gov\n\n\t\t\t\t1.1 Basic Information\nWhen a computer is used to access information on WhiteHouse.gov, the following basic information is automatically received and stored by the White House web servers hosting WhiteHouse.gov:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInternet Protocol (IP) Address.\u00a0 A computer\u2019s IP address establishes its location on the internet and allows other computers, such as those hosting WhiteHouse.gov, to send it content and other information;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe internet domain name when a computer accesses the internet through a domain, such as from a corporation (\u201cxcompany.com\u201d) or university (\"yourschool.edu\");\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe date, time, and duration of a website visit;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf a computer accesses a page on WhiteHouse.gov via a link on another page, the URL of that referring, non-WhiteHouse.gov page;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInformation about the computer set-up, such as the type and version of web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer 8.0, Mozilla Firefox 5.0), operating system (e.g., Unix, Mac OS, MS Windows), Java support (yes or no), Flash version (e.g., 10.1 r85), screen resolution (e.g., 1280x800), and connection speed (e.g., DSL, T1);\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe specific pages a computer accesses when it requests information from \u00a0WhiteHouse.gov; and\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tThe amount of data (measured in number of bytes) transmitted from WhiteHouse.gov to a computer.\nThe White House does not use this information to identify or track the browsing of individual users.\u00a0 We do use it to generate aggregate statistics about how WhiteHouse.gov is used.\u00a0 We retain this information for a year\u2014for example, server logs from June 2011 will be deleted in June 2012.\n\n\nWe do not sell, rent, exchange, or otherwise disclose this information to persons or organizations outside the Executive Office of the President.\u00a0 In some cases, we may share the information with other federal agencies in response to lawful law enforcement requests or to protect WhiteHouse.gov from security threats.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t1.2. Website Measurement and Customization Technologies (E.g., Cookies)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1.2.1. First-party (WhiteHouse.gov) Website Measurement and Customization Technologies\nThe White House uses web measurement and customization technologies to make WhiteHouse.gov function better for visitors and to better understand how the public is using the website.\n\n\nThis means that when you visit a page on WhiteHouse.gov, the internet browser on your computer may download and save a small file from WhiteHouse.gov (commonly called a \u201ccookie\u201d) so that our website can recognize your specific computer and browser when you use WhiteHouse.gov in the future.\u00a0 The White House does not use technologies that track your interactions on non-WhiteHouse.gov websites.\n\n\nInformation on how to control these web measurement and customization technologies can be found in Section 1.2.3: How you can control website measurement and customization technologies.\nThese technologies fall into two categories, based on the length of time they remain active:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSingle-session cookies last only as long as a web browser is open.\u00a0 Once the browser is closed, the data files on your computer are deleted.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMulti-session cookies last beyond a single session of browsing a website; this allows a website to recognize a computer or user for defined amount of time.\nWhiteHouse.gov uses the following web measurement and customization technologies (defined and organized per the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s \u201cGuidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies\u201d (OMB M-10-22)):\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSession cookies are used for technical purposes, such as enabling better navigation through the site, facilitating the use of user accounts (see Section 1.4), and generating aggregated statistics about how the website is used. Under the framework of OMB M-10-22, this qualifies as a Tier 1 use.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPersistent cookies are used to recognize a computer that has previously visited WhiteHouse.gov, which can improve a user\u2019s experience, for example by continuing preference settings from previous visits. \u00a0WhiteHouse.gov currently uses the following first-party persistent cookies:\u00a0 When a visitor views a welcome, or \u2018splash,\u2019 page, WhiteHouse.gov sets a persistent cookie to prevent them from seeing that page repeatedly.\u00a0 This cookie does not collect personal identifying information.\u00a0 WhiteHouse.gov sets three persistent cookies to measure website metrics, such as which pages are popular and how often people visit the website. These cookies do not collect personal identifying information.\u00a0 Under the framework of OMB M-10-22, this qualifies as a Tier 2 use.\nThe White House uses a third-party analytics provider (currently Google Analytics) to analyze the data collected through the session and persistent metrics cookies.\u00a0 The third-party analytics provider does not receive personally identifiable information through these cookies and does not combine, match, or cross-reference WhiteHouse.gov information with any other information.\u00a0 Please review the third-party analytics provider\u2019s privacy policy for additional information.\n\n\nThese cookies collect information similar to that automatically received and stored on the servers hosting WhiteHouse.gov; they do not collect personal indentifying information.\u00a0 The White House generally does not access or store the raw information collected through these cookies.\u00a0 We do view aggregate statistical analyses prepared by our third-party analytics provider, but these analyses do not include any personally identifiable information.\u00a0 We do not sell, rent, exchange, or otherwise disclose this information to persons or organizations outside the Executive Office of the President.\u00a0 In some cases, we may share information with other federal agencies in response to lawful law enforcement requests or to protect WhiteHouse.gov from security threats.\u00a0 As explained in section 1.2.3, you can control website measurement and customization technologies on WhiteHouse.gov.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1.2.2. Third-party website measurement and customization technologies\nSome pages on WhiteHouse.gov may include web content or functionality from third parties, such as embedded videos hosted by non-WhiteHouse.gov services.\u00a0 For example, as of July 16, 2012, content or functionality from the following third parties may be present on some WhiteHouse.gov pages:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYouTube.com;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVimeo.com;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFlickr.com;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSocrata.com;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGoogle Moderator;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLivestream.com;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUStream.com;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMapBox.com;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSlideShare;\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tScribd.com; and\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSoundCloud.com\nFor your convenience, this list will be updated on a regular basis to reflect the third party providers of content or functionality that are commonly used on WhiteHouse.gov.\u00a0 If you would like to receive content that is posted using one of these third-party providers without utilizing the third-party provider, please contact us at http://www.whitehouse.gov/tech/feedback.\u00a0\nThese third parties may use web measurement and customization technologies (such as cookies) in conjunction with the provision of this content or functionality.\u00a0 You should consult the privacy policies of these third parties for further information.\u00a0 We do not knowingly use third-party tools that place a multi-session cookie prior to the user interacting with the tool, for example by playing an embedded video.\u00a0 If you become aware of a third-party tool on WhiteHouse.gov that places a multi-session cookie prior to any user interaction, please contact us at http://www.whitehouse.gov/privacy/feedback\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t1.2.3. How you can control website measurement and customization technologies\nVisitors can control aspects of website measurement and customization technologies used on WhiteHouse.gov.\u00a0 Visitors who choose to disable these technologies will still have access to comparable information and services on WhiteHouse.gov.\nOne of the most common forms of website measurement and customization technologies is the use of \u201ccookies.\u201d\u00a0 You can choose not to accept cookies from any website, including WhiteHouse.gov, by changing the settings of your browser.\u00a0 You can also delete cookies stored in your browser at any time.\u00a0\nHere is a list of the cookies that are used by WhiteHouse.gov:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCookies that begin with wh_splash are used to prevent users from seeing welcome, or \u2018splash,\u2019 pages repeatedly.\u00a0 These cookies do not use a unique identifier.\n\nCookies that have a name that begin with _utm are each unique and are used for the purpose of website analytics.\u00a0\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCookies with the name \u201chas_js\u201d are used to track if a user\u2019s browser has Javascript enabled,and cookies with the name \u201cd\u201d are used to track if the website should present in a desktop or mobile format; these cookies persist on a session basis only.\u00a0 These cookies do no use a unique identifier.\nThis list will be updated frequently with other cookies used by WhiteHouse.gov.\u00a0 This list does not include cookies associated with third-party content or functionality included on WhiteHouse.gov (see section 1.2.2.).\n\n\nFor more information about cookies, including how to delete them from your computer and configure your browser to refuse them from WhiteHouse.gov or any other site, visit the following resources:\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUSA.gov\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGetNetWise\nAnother form of website measurement and customization technology is the use of \u201cflash cookies\u201d which are created by Adobe Flash, a technology that powers web content such as videos.\u00a0 To manage these, visit the Website Storage Settings Panel on Adobe.com.\u00a0 WhiteHouse.gov does not currently use first-party flash cookies, but they may be used by third party technologies included in WhiteHouse.gov (see section 1.2.2.).\u00a0\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t1.3. Personal information that you voluntarily submit to WhiteHouse.gov\nIf you choose to provide us with personal information, for example by completing a \u201cContact Us\u201d form, signing up for our email list, or leaving a comment, we may use that information to respond to your message and/or to help us get you the information or services you requested.\u00a0 Submitting this personal information (name, address, telephone number, email address, etc.) is voluntary and is not required to access information on WhiteHouse.gov.\nThis information will likely be retained by the White House until the end of the current Administration, at which time it will be transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in accordance with the Presidential Records Act (PRA).\u00a0 NARA may eventually release this material to the public, but is required, in accordance with the PRA and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), to withhold any information that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy if released.\u00a0 NARA may also dispose of this information if it determines it to lack value, in accordance with the PRA; the White House may also dispose of it on the same grounds after notifying NARA in accordance with the PRA.\u00a0 Access to this information may be requested under FOIA five years after the end of the current Administration.\nInformation you voluntarily submit through WhiteHouse.gov, such as your name, city, state, and comments on public issues, may be treated as public information. We may, for example, publish compilations of comments collected through WhiteHouse.gov or provide them to national leaders, members of the press or other individuals outside of the federal government.\u00a0 We exercise discretion to protect voluntarily submitted information if its disclosure would raise privacy concerns.\u00a0 Except as described above, we do not sell, rent, exchange, or otherwise disclose this information to persons or organizations outside the Executive Office of the President.\u00a0 In some cases, we may share information with other federal agencies in response to lawful law enforcement requests or to protect WhiteHouse.gov from security threats.\u00a0 Additionally, if you seek assistance on a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency, we may share your information with that agency for the limited purpose of addressing your request for assistance.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t1.4. WhiteHouse.gov User Accounts\nWhiteHouse.gov includes features, such as We the People, that may require users to create a user account in order to access their full functionality. Setting up an account requires the user to provide a valid email address and a first and last name. We use this information to communicate with you and to identify content you create with the account. The features that require a user account may set first party session cookies to maintain a user's login.\nSome of the information provided to set up a user account (your name and zip code) and user-generated content created with the account may be treated as public information (see Section 1.3). We will not disclose, sell, rent, or exchange the email address you use to create your account to individuals or organizations outside the Executive Office of the President.\nData from White House user accounts are not associated with server logs or website analytics.\nWhile users may be unable to contribute content to some features on WhiteHouse.gov without an account, they are free to view the site and content generated by others. Those who wish to communicate with the White House but do not wish to create a user account may do so via the Contact the White House page.\n\n\n\n\t\tLinks on WhiteHouse.gov to External Sites\nWhiteHouse.gov may contain links to web sites created and maintained by other public and/or private organizations and individuals.\u00a0 WhiteHouse.gov provides these links as a service to our users.\u00a0 When you follow a link to an external site, you are leaving WhiteHouse.gov and are subject to the privacy and security policies of the owners/sponsors of the external site. WhiteHouse.gov does not control or guarantee the accuracy, relevance, timeliness, or completeness of information contained in a linked site.\u00a0 We also do not endorse the organizations or individuals maintaining sites that we link, any views they express, or any products/services they offer.\u00a0\n\n\n\t\tVisiting Official White House Pages on Third-Party Websites\nThe White House maintains official pages or accounts on several third-party web sites in order to better engage with the American public (a current list is below).\u00a0 Your activity on those third-party sites is governed by the security and privacy policies of the third party sites.\u00a0 Users of third-party sites are often sharing information with the general public, user community, and/or the third-party operating the third-party site.\u00a0 These actors may use this information in a variety of ways.\u00a0 Consequently, you should review the privacy policies of third-party sites before using them and ensure that you understand how your information may be used.\u00a0 You should also adjust privacy settings on your account on any third-party site to match your preferences.\u00a0\nThe White House archives some information that users submit or publish when engaging with the White House through official White House pages or accounts.\u00a0 The White House archives this information to comply with the Presidential Records Act (PRA).\u00a0 For example, on the social media service Twitter, the White House archives posts (i.e. \u201ctweets\u201d) from official White House accounts, \u201cdirect messages\u201d sent to official White House accounts, and \u201creplies,\u201d which are tweets from other users to official White House accounts (these tweets begin with @ and the username of an official White House account, e.g., @WhiteHouse).\u00a0 This information may contain PII, such as an individual\u2019s username and any PII they elect to submit or publish.\u00a0\u00a0 The White House does not archive any PII about users who merely visit a White House page on a third-party site or who only \u201cfollow,\u201d \u201cfriend,\u201d or take a similar action with respect to the official White House page on a third-party site \u2014 PII may only be archived when it is voluntarily submitted to or published on the White House page on a third-party site (e.g., by sending a message or posting a comment).\u00a0 This information may be retained by the White House until the end of the current Administration, at which time any archived information will be transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in accordance with the PRA.\u00a0 NARA may eventually release this material to the public, but is required, in accordance with the PRA and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), to withhold any information that would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy if released.\u00a0 Access to this information may be requested under FOIA five years after the end of the current Administration.\nInformation, including PII, that you voluntarily submit to or publish on a White House page on a third-party site may be treated as public information. \u00a0We may, for example, publish compilations of comments collected through these White House pages or provide them to national leaders, members of the press or other individuals outside of the federal government.\u00a0 We exercise discretion to protect voluntarily submitted information if its disclosure would raise privacy concerns.\u00a0 Except as described above, we do not sell, rent, exchange, or otherwise disclose this information to persons or organizations outside the Executive Office of the President.\u00a0 In some cases, we may share information with other federal agencies in response to lawful law enforcement requests or to protect WhiteHouse.gov from security threats.\u00a0 Additionally, if you seek assistance on a matter within the jurisdiction of a federal agency, we may share your information with that agency for the limited purpose of addressing your request for assistance.\nIn some instances, a first-party session cookie may be set via third-party websites that feature embedded content served by WhiteHouse.gov (see Section 1.2.1).\nThe White House has conducted and published a Privacy Impact Assessment of Third-Party Sites, which includes more information about these issues and can be accessed here.\nBelow is the current list of official White House pages on third party websites.\u00a0 For more information, read our blog post on these

maintains several lists of subscribers who have asked to receive periodic email updates. \u00a0Any recipient of a White House email may unsubscribe from future messages via a link at the bottom of each email message.\u00a0 We do not sell, rent, exchange, or otherwise disclose our list subscribers to persons or organizations outside the Executive Office of the President.\u00a0\nMessages sent from the White House to email subscribers may include a tracking pixel to provide basic aggregate analytics such as the percentage of recipients who opened an email or clicked on a link in an email, the percentage of subscribers using various email clients, and the number of times an email was forwarded or printed.\u00a0 Our email analytics providers, GovDelivery and Litmus, also offer the capability to view some data, such as whether a mass email was opened, at an individual level for 30 days after an email was sent; as a matter of policy and practice this data is only viewed on an aggregate basis.\n\n\n\t\tChildren and Privacy on WhiteHouse.gov\nWe believe in the importance of protecting the privacy of children online and do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. \u00a0Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13.\u00a0 To notify us of our receipt of information by children under 13, please contact us through the Privacy Feedback form.\n\n\n\t\tSecurity of WhiteHouse.gov\nWe take reasonable precautions to protect our site and information automatically collected by WhiteHouse.gov or voluntarily submitted to WhiteHouse.gov or an official White House page on a third-party site. For example, we restrict access to information collected by or submitted to WhiteHouse.gov or official White House pages of on third-party sites to employees who access it to perform their official duties. \u00a0Access to official White House accounts on third-party sites is limited to the staff who administer those accounts, and all official White House accounts are clearly labeled.\u00a0 We also utilize commonly used practices and technical controls to protect this information, along with WhiteHouse.gov itself.\u00a0 These practices and controls include, but are not limited to, encrypting the transfer of personal information over the Internet via Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), using high-strength firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS) to safeguard personal information and maintaining strict technical controls and procedures to ensure the integrity of all data on WhiteHouse.gov. We periodically review our processes and systems to verify compliance with industry best practices and ensure the highest level of security for our website.\n\n\n\t\tUpdates to this privacy policy\nUpdated: January 3, 2013\nPrevious version(s) of this policy may be accessed on the archive page.\n\n    \n  ",
