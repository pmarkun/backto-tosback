resources on the World Wide Web.  \u00a0An IP address is an identifier for a computer  or device on a network,  such as the World Wide Web. \u00a0An IP address is a number that is   automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the  Web,  allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer.  \u00a0Computers require IP addresses in order for  users to communicate on  the Internet.\r\n            Collection Methods and Use of Information\r\n             We do not collect any Personally Identifiable  Information about you  on this site unless you voluntarily provide
