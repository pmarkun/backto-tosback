This privacy protection section communicates how, when, and why we gather information about our customers and what we do with it.\r\n\t\tWebsite Security Guarantee\r\n\t\tWe have taken many precautions to insure that shopping at UncommonGoods is safe and secure. We use the industry-standard SSL protocol (Secure Sockets Layer) to ensure that all credit card transactions are secure. The SSL system encrypts information that you submit to us via our Web site when you place an order. Encryption makes it extremely difficult for anyone to intercept information about you, your order, or your credit card information.\r\n\t\tIP Address\r\n\t\tTo ensure a smooth shopping experience, our system logs the Internet Protocol (IP) Address of each user. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer every time you browse the internet. Depending on your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the type of connection this number may change each time you log on. Information from IP addresses is used for system administration, our live help feature, troubleshooting, and the examination of traffic trends and response rates to various promotional offers. This data is used in the aggregate, and is not linked to personally identifiable information.\r\n\t\tOrder Information\r\n\t\tIf you place an order through UncommonGoods, we will ask you for your name, e-mail address, shipping address, telephone number and credit card information. We use this information to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. All archived credit card information is maintained in a secure and safe environment. Telephone numbers and e-mail addresses are only used to contact you regarding your order, unless you request to receive our e-mail newsletter updates.\r\n\t\tEmail List\r\n\t\tWhen you sign up for our email, we ask for your first name and e-mail address. We do not rent, sell or share our email list.\r\n\t\tIf you do not wish to receive our email anymore, an unsubscribe button is located at the bottom of each email for your convenience. Or you can send us an email with the subject line \"Unsubscribe me\" to remove@uncommongoods.com.\r\n\t\tCatalog Mailings\r\n\t\tAnyone who purchases from us or signs up will receive a catalog from us.\r\n\t\tWe may make portions of our mailing list available to carefully screened companies. Consequently, if you sign up to receive our catalog or make a purchase with us, you may receive other catalogs whose products or services might interest you.\r\n\t\tIf you do not want to receive a catalog from UncommonGoods, please send an email with your name and address to remove@uncommongoods.com.
