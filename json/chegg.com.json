THIS SUMMARY PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING\n\tOUR USE AND SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION, AND THIRD PARTIES WHO MAY SERVE ADVERTISEMENTS AND WHO MAY SET COOKIES OR WEB BEACONS OR SIMILAR TRACKING\n\tTECHNOLOGIES WHEN YOU USE THE SERVICES, BUT PLEASE REVIEW OUR FULL PRIVACY POLICY BEFORE USING OUR SERVICES.\n\n\tWe primarily use the information we collect when you use the Services in connection with your relationship with Chegg, your use of the Services, and for\n\tsending you information from us or on behalf of certain third parties. This includes linking you to other members of the Chegg community and providing\n\toffers to you based on information you provide or we collect or your use of the Services. Please review the \"INFORMATION COLLECTION\"\n\tand \"HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION\" sections of this Privacy Policy for a full description of the information we collect, including\n\tPersonal Information, and how we use that information. Remember that if you create a Profile or participate in community forums and similar features on the\n\tServices, your information may be public. Note that we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes without your\n\tconsent; however, we may share your Personal Information under certain limited circumstances. For more details, please review the section below entitled\n\t\"Information Sharing.\"\n\n\tChegg works with network advertisers, ad agencies , analytics service providers and other vendors to serve third party advertisements on and through the\n\tServices, to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Services, including the pages viewed and the actions users take when visiting the\n\tServices; to serve our advertisements on other web sites, within mobile Apps, and elsewhere online; and to provide us with information regarding the use of\n\tthe Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. For example, if you click on a Chegg advertisement, our service provider(s) may be able to tell\n\tus the advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement. You may also see third party ads on the Services. The advertisements you\n\tsee may be served by one or more third parties, who may use information about your activities on the Services, and other web sites and services, to provide\n\tyou targeted advertising based upon your interests. We do not share Personal Information (information that identifies you as a specific individual, such as\n\tyour name or e-mail address) with these third parties, but ad network providers, the advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and other\n\tvendors may set and access their own tracking devices (including cookies and web beacons) and they may otherwise collect or\n\thave access to information about you and your online browsing activities. Please review \"THIRD PARTY AD NETWORKS AND ANALYTICS\n\tPROVIDERS\" for additional information. Some of the companies who serve these targeted ads participate in a self-regulatory program that allows you to\n\topt-out of having information about you used for this purpose, and you may access that opt-out by clicking here. \n\tPlease note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads\n\twhile using the Services and elsewhere online.\n\n\tINFORMATION COLLECTION\n\n\t1. Registration and Other Information You Provide\n\n\tThe Services may collect \"Personal Information\" (which is information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual,\n\tsuch as your name and email address), account information (such as a password or other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your\n\taccount) and demographic or other information (such as your school, gender, age or birthdate and zip code and information about your interests and\n\tpreferences). We will also collect payment information (typically, credit card account information) if you choose to purchase products or services through\n\tthe Services. Any information combined with Personal Information will be treated as Personal Information.\n\n\t2. Your Profile, Community Forums and User Content\n\n\tYou may have the opportunity to create a profile, which consists of information about you, which may include Personal Information, photographs,\n\tinformation about your academic and work history, your interests and activities, your use of the Services and other information (\"Profile\"). Some of the\n\tinformation in your Profile may be visible to third parties or to everyone, depending on the nature of the information and the privacy settings you choose\n\twhen you sign in and go to your Account on the website or other Services where you created your Profile. Chegg may also make the information contained in\n\tyour Profile accessible through means other than the Chegg website (such as through an app or an application programming interface (API)). Your Profile may\n\talso be indexed by and displayed by internet search providers when someone searches for your name. Chegg does not control how frequently third-party search\n\tengines update their indexes; consequently their information may be outdated and still available for a period of time even if you discontinue use of the\n\tservice.\n\n\tNote that in order to provide services and opportunities to you, educational organizations, scholarship providers and other third parties may be\n\table to review certain information in your Profile , whether or not you have limited public access to that information . You may have the opportunity to\n\tcontrol whether this information is shared, but some information may be shared automatically -- all as disclosed on the website or other Services where you\n\tcreated your Profile. Chegg does not share your contact information (email, full postal address or phone number) with those third parties unless you\n\trequest or agree to that sharing. However, Chegg may send you information and offers from third parties and information about the Services, and you may not\n\tbe able to opt-out from these messages without closing your account.\n\n\tThe Services may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly in forums, through interactive features and through other\n\tcommunication functionality (\"Community Forums\"). You may choose, through such features or otherwise, to submit or post reviews, problems, suggestions,\n\tideas, solutions, questions, answers, class notes, course outlines, comments, testimonials, feedback, messages, images, videos, text or other material\n\t(\"User Content\"). Your User Content may also be posted in your Profile. You may edit or remove your profile information, but you may not\n\tbe able to remove answers or postings or other uploaded material.\n\n\tNote that anything you post to a Community Forum may be public. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information in your\n\tProfile or a Community Forum, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not\n\tapply.\n\n\tIn addition, the Services may allow members to communicate and collaborate with each other. If you create an account, participate in a Community Forum\n\tor choose to communicate with others through the Services, certain information about you may be disclosed in connection with your or others use of the\n\tServices, including certain information about you and your network (such as your name and profile photo, the number of your connections, and the names and\n\tpictures of your connections). We allow other users to use contact information they have about you, such as your email address, to find you, including\n\tthrough contact importers and search, and they may also contact you through the Services.\n\n\t3. Third Party Services, Social Media Platforms, and Information Third Parties Provide About You\n\n\tThird parties may provide us with information about you. For example, if you are on a third party web site, and you opt-in to receive information from\n\tus, that third party will forward information about you to us so that we may contact you as requested.\n\n\tThe Services may permit interactions between the Services and a third party web site or service, such as enabling you to \"like\" a product within our\n\tServices or \"share\" content to other web sites. If you choose to \"like\" or \"share\" content or to otherwise post information from or via the Services to a\n\tthird party web site, feature or application, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party web site may have access to information about\n\tyou and your use of our Services. Similarly, if you post information on a third party platform that references Chegg or one of the Services, your post may\n\tbe published on our Services in accordance with terms of that third party. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our\n\tweb site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted\n\tdirectly on our Services. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.\n\n\tYou may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature through our Services (such as logging in through Facebook Connect or\n\totherwise linking the Services with another web site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such as one of our Facebook\n\tapplications or a similar application or feature on a third party web site or service) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share)\n\tinformation about you, including personal information. Information about you, including your name and profile photo, may be shown to other users of the\n\tServices if you are logged in through the Services or through a third party web site or service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or\n\tfeature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously\n\tcollected. When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on our Services with that third party web site or service, which may\n\tthen collect information about your visits to our Services and may publish that activity as you request to your profile or similar feature with that third\n\tparty (such as if you choose to share a purchase you made on Chegg.com with your connections on the third party website). In addition, we may receive\n\tinformation about you if other users of a third party web site give us access to their profiles and you are one of their \"connections\" or information about\n\tyou is otherwise accessible through your \"connections\" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or\n\tinteractive service.\n\n\tThe information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third\n\tparty's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with\n\tregard to what is visible to others on that third party web site and service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which\n\tcase we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. In\n\taddition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site or service give us access to their profiles and you are one of\n\ttheir \"connections\" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your \"connections\" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social\n\tnetworking or other third party web site or interactive service.\n\n\tWe also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third parties in order to provide you with information, services or goods\n\tyou have requested, to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you and to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that\n\twe believe may be of interest to you. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Services.\n\tIn those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.\n\n\t4. Referral Features and Gift Certificates\n\n\tThe Services may offer referral features whereby users may use an email tool to invite friends to use the Services using a one-time email. Chegg stores\n\tthis information for the purpose of verification, as well as tracking the success of our referral program. Chegg will not use those referred email\n\taddresses for any other purpose (unless, of course, the referred user comes to a Service and registers as a user, in which case Chegg may use the email\n\taddress provided by the referred user in accordance with this Privacy Policy). The referred person may contact us at legaldept@chegg.com to request that we remove this information from our active database.\n\n\tIf you purchase a gift certificate for another person, we will ask you for that person's name and email address, as well as for an optional personal\n\tmessage. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email including an invitation to visit the Services as well as their gift code. Chegg stores\n\tinformation such as the gift certificate recipient's name and email address for the sole purpose of verification. Chegg does not sell or disclose any of\n\tthis information to any outside sources or parties and collects this information only to maintain records that a gift certificate was purchased and sent to\n\ta recipient. Vouchers purchased through Cheggdeals are not gift certificates and must be used according to the terms of the voucher.\n\n\t5. Information Chegg Collects Automatically When You Access The Services\n\n\tLike other websites and online services, we and our analytics providers and other third party service providers may automatically collect certain \"Usage\n\tInformation\" whenever you access and use the Services, including, without limitation, by viewing information about a course or school, renting a textbook,\n\tasking or answering questions, viewing another user's profile, sending a message, searching for a person or information, or by clicking on an\n\tadvertisement.\n\n\tUsage Information may include the browser and operating system you are using, the URL or advertisement that referred you to our Services (if\n\tapplicable), the search terms you entered into a search engine that lead you to our Services (if applicable), all of the areas within our Services that you\n\tvisit (including information about any ads you may view), and the time of day you used the Services, among other information. We may use Usage Information\n\tfor a variety of purposes, including to tell you about people or events nearby, to provide special offers, to serve advertisements, to select appropriate\n\tcontent to display to you, and to enhance or otherwise improve the Services and our products.\n\n\tIn addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier (\"Device Identifier\") for any computer, mobile phone or other device\n\t(any, a \"Device\") you may use to access the Services. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used to access a\n\tService, and our servers identify your Device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party service\n\tproviders with information regarding the physical location of the Device used to access a Service. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if\n\twe associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.\n\n\tUsage Information is collected via tracking technologies, including:\n\n\tCookies and Log Files: Chegg uses cookies and web log files to track usage of our Services. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides\n\ton your computer, and which allows Chegg to recognize you as a user when you return using the same computer and web browser. If your browser settings do\n\tnot allow cookies, you will not be able to use our Services as fully as intended. Log files are the record of your visits to the Services and include Usage\n\tInformation. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience when you use\n\tthe Services. Third parties may also set cookies as you interact with the Service.\n\n\tOne type of cookie we use, known as a \"persistent\" cookie, is set once you've logged in to your account on the Services. If you do not log out of your\n\taccount, then the next time you visit, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using\n\tthe Services. Of course, if you are using a public computer or sharing your private computer with others, you should log out of your account after each\n\tvisit. If you log out of a Service, you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. We also use a\n\tcookie which functions as a \"session\" cookie, meaning that it is used to identify a particular visit. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you\n\tclose your web browser.\n\n\tWeb Beacons: We, as well as our affiliate program partners, service providers, and other third parties, may employ a software\n\ttechnology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), that help us better manage content on our Services by informing us of what content is\n\teffective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users\n\tfor our affiliate program. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are\n\tabout the size of the period at the end of this sentence. This information is used to help improve the overall quality and experience of our Services.\n\n\tAn Embedded Script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the\n\tlinks you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your computer or other device from our server or a third party service provider and is\n\tdeactivated or deleted when you disconnect from the Services.\n\n\tIn addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.\n\n\tHOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION\n\n\tWe use information about you, including Personal Information, the information you provide in your Profile, User Content, and Usage Information to: (1)\n\tallow you to participate in features we offer or to provide related customer service, including, without limitation, to respond to your questions,\n\tcomplaints or comments; (2) tailor content, recommendations and offers we display to you; (3) process a transaction you initiate; (4) provide you with\n\tinformation, products, services, or suggestions; (5) send or display to you and others using the Services special offers or advertisements from us, our\n\tadvertisers, or third-parties; (6) process your registration with our Services, including verifying your e-mail address is active and valid; (7) improve\n\tthe Services and our products, and for internal business purposes, including the measurement of ad effectiveness; (8) contact you with regard to your use\n\tof the Services and, in our discretion, changes to our policies; and (9) permit other Chegg users to contact you, and vice versa; (10) to provide you with\n\tlocation features and services (e.g., telling you about local deals and events); and (11) as described in the Privacy Policy and for purposes disclosed at\n\tthe time you provide your information or otherwise with your consent.\n\n\tNote that we may create, facilitate or display social advertisements, whereby your name and profile photo may be used to advertise products and services\n\tto your network based on your use of the Services and your interactions with Chegg and third parties through the Services. If we are utilizing Social Ads\n\ton one of our Services, you will be able to opt-out through your account settings for that Service.\n\n\tPlease note that information submitted on the Services via a \"Contact Us\" or other similar function may not receive a response. We will not use the\n\tinformation provided via these functions to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request unless you agree otherwise.\n\n\tINFORMATION SHARING\n\n\tChegg does not share your Personal Information with third parties for their marketing purposes without your consent. Chegg may share non-Personal\n\tInformation, such as aggregate user statistics, demographic information and Usage Information with third parties, including advertisers, content providers,\n\tand analytics providers; and third parties may collect non-Personal Information when you visit the Services. We also may share your Personal Information\n\twith third parties with your consent, as disclosed at the time you provide us with information, and as described below or otherwise in this Privacy\n\tPolicy:\n\n\t1. Educational Institutions: We work with colleges, universities, scholarship providers and educational institutions (\"Educational\n\tInstitutions\") to provide targeted recruiting and outreach to some of our members. We may allow Educational Institutions to review information in your\n\tProfile (such as hometown, grade point average, and graduation year), whether or not you have chosen to restrict public access to some of that information.\n\tHowever, we do not share your contact information (email address, full postal address or phone number) with these Educational Institutions without your\n\tconsent, but we may send you information on their behalf. This is a fundamental element of our free Services. In addition, you may indicate that you would\n\tlike to receive additional information from Educational Institutions or other third parties and we will then share your information with those parties so\n\tthat they may contact you per your request. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of third parties. If you later decide that you no\n\tlonger want to receive communications from a third party, you will need to contact that third party directly.\n\n\t2. When You Request That We Share Your Information. We may offer opportunities and features through the Services that are brought to\n\tyou by a third party or that otherwise involve sharing your information with a third party. If you request or agree at that time to have your information\n\tshared, your information will be disclosed to that third party (or parties) and will be subject to the privacy policy and practices of that third party.\n\tYou also may request, sometimes through your use of an interactive feature, a widget or third party application, that we share information about you with a\n\tthird party and we will typically do so under those circumstances.\n\n\t3. Service Providers. We will share your Personal Information with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific\n\tservices to you or to us as part of our Services, but subject to confidentiality obligations which limit their use and disclosure of such information. If\n\tyou purchase any products or services, our billing partner will receive billing and financial information (e.g., credit card numbers) necessary to process\n\tyour charges, including your postal and e-mail addresses, depending on your payment method.\n\n\t4. Administrative, Legal Reasons & Academic Integrity Investigations. We may also disclose your information, including Personal\n\tInformation, in response to a subpoena or when required by law; to defend our rights; in response to a written request from law enforcement regarding an\n\tinvestigation into criminal activity that may have occurred through or in any way using Chegg's Services or property; to provide information to a claimed\n\towner of intellectual property who claims that content you have provided to us infringes on their rights; upon request of an academic institution connected\n\tto an investigation into academic integrity to protect and/or defend any applicable Terms of Use or other policies applicable to the Services; or to\n\tprotect the personal safety, rights, property or security of any organization or individual. We may also use Device Identifiers, including IP addresses, to\n\tidentify users, and may do so in cooperation with copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies in\n\tour discretion. These disclosures may be carried out without notice to you.\n\n\t5. Business Transitions Chegg may share Personal Information with its parent, subsidiaries and affiliates, primarily for business and\n\toperational purposes. In the event that Chegg goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a\n\tportion of its assets, or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process, your information,\n\tincluding Personal Information, will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on Services of any\n\tchange in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. This Privacy Policy will\n\tbecome binding upon the new owner of the information until amended.\n\n\tSweepstakes, Contests and Promotions. We may offer sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (\"Promotion\") that may require\n\tregistration. By participating in a Promotion, you are agreeing to governing terms, conditions or official rules, which may contain specific requirements\n\tof you, including allowing the sponsor(s) of the Promotion to use your name, voice, likeness or other indicia of persona in advertising or marketing\n\tassociated with the Promotion. If you choose to enter a Promotion, Personal Information, such as your name and shipping address, may be disclosed to third\n\tparties or the public in connection with the administration of such Promotion, including, without limitation, in connection with winner selection, prize\n\tfulfillment, and as required by law or permitted by the Promotion's official rules, such as on a winners list.\n\n\tTHIRD PARTY AD NETWORKS AND ANALYTICS PROVIDERS\n\n\tChegg works with network advertisers, ad agencies , analytics service providers and other vendors to serve third party advertisements on and through the\n\tServices, to provide us with information regarding traffic on the Services, including the pages viewed and the actions users take when visiting the\n\tServices; to serve our advertisements on other web sites, within mobile Apps, and elsewhere online; and to provide us with information regarding the use of\n\tthe Services and the effectiveness of our advertisements. For example, if you click on a Chegg advertisement, our service provider(s) may be able to tell\n\tus the advertisement you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement; likewise, if you click on an ad you see on our Services, our service\n\tprovider(s) may be able to tell which page you were visiting on our Services and pass that information to the advertiser. The advertisements you see may be\n\tserved by one or more third parties, who may use information about your activities on the Services, and other web sites and services, to provide you\n\ttargeted advertising based upon your interests.\n\n\tSome of the companies who serve these targeted ads participate in a self-regulatory program that allows you to opt-out of having information about you\n\tused for this purpose, and you may access that opt-out by clicking here. Please note this does not opt you out\n\tof being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while using the Services and elsewhere online.\n\n\tWe may share Usage Information about visitors with third party advertising companies, analytics providers and other vendors. We do not share Personal\n\tInformation (information that identifies you as a specific individual, such as your name or e-mail address) with these third parties, but ad network\n\tproviders, the advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and other vendors may set and access their own tracking devices (including cookies\n\tand web beacons) and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you (such as your general interest in\n\thigher education and scholarships) and your online browsing activities.\n\n\tMOBILE USE\n\n\tIf you use the Services through a mobile device or our mobile application, your mobile device ID, your mobile carrier, and your physical (GPS) location\n\tmay be transmitted to Chegg.

If you wish to no longer allow Chegg to track your physical locations you may turn this off within your device settings. When you\n\tplace an order through the Services, you may be able to opt-in to receiving text messaging reminders from Chegg. If you choose to do so, you must provide\n\tto Chegg your telephone number, which Chegg will store and use to send reminders to you. You may always opt-out by replying \"STOP\" to one of the text\n\tmessages received. You also acknowledge and agree that use of the Services through a mobile device may cause data to be displayed on and through your\n\tmobile device which may be viewed by your mobile carrier or other access provider.\n\n\tUPDATING YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION AND CONTROL OVER YOUR PROFILE\n\n\tYou may be able to review the information you provided to us on a Service and make any desired changes to the information, or to the settings for your\n\taccount on that Service, by logging in to your account for that Service and editing or deleting the information. You also may be able to limit the\n\tinformation you receive from us by adjusting your settings. However, we reserve the right to send you information on our behalf and on behalf of third\n\tparties in connection with providing the Services.

Alternatively, the law provides that a company that\n\thas a privacy policy that provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third parties'\n\tdirect marketing purposes may instead provide information on how to exercise that choice. Chegg qualifies for the alternative option; it has a\n\tcomprehensive privacy policy that sets forth that Chegg provides you choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct\n\tmarketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you do not choose to opt-out at the time Chegg offers that choice, Chegg does not share your information\n\twith that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.\n\n\tIf you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct\n\tmarketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please send your request to the following email address: legaldept@chegg.com or write to us at the\n\tfollowing mailing address: 3990 Freedom Circle, Santa Clara, CA 95054.
