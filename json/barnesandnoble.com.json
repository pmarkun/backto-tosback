What other information about Barnes & Noble's Privacy Policy would I want to know?\r\nBarnes & Noble Policies for Minors, including Children under the age of 13.\r\nExcept as noted below with respect to Kid's Profiles: (i) our products and services are marketed for and directed towards purchase by adults or with the consent of adults; (ii) Individuals under the age of 18 (\"Minors\") are not permitted to use Barnes & Noble Websites or Retail Apps without the supervision of a parent or legal guardian; (iii)  we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for an online account or to post personal information on the Barnes & Noble Websites; and (iv) should we learn that someone under the age of 13 has provided any personal information to or on any of the Barnes & Noble Websites, we will remove that information as soon as possible.\r\nKid's Profiles\r\nBarnes & Noble does not permit Minors to create a master account with Barnes & Noble or register a Device in his or her name. However, certain Devices do offer parents and legal guardians the opportunity to create a personal profile for their child, including children under the age of 13, to allow for a more personalized Device experience (a \"Kid's Profile\").\r\nThe creation of a Kid's Profile requires that the parent or legal guardian provide Barnes & Noble with verifiable consent to Barnes & Noble's collection of information in connection with the child's use of  the Kid's Profile. Upon creation of a Kid's Profile, Barnes & Noble will validate credit card information already on file with us and e-mail the master account holder to give notice that we have received consent.  If no credit card information is on file, or if the credit card is invalid, Barnes & Noble will not permit the creation of a Kid's Profile. In order for a parent or legal guardian of a child who is under the age of 13 to create a Kid's Profile on the Device, that child's parent or legal guardian must first create a master user account and authorize the creation of a Kid's Profile for the child who is under 13.   \r\nDuring the Kid's Profile setup process, Barnes & Noble will collect the first name or nickname and month and year of birth of your child.  This information will be used to tailor the Device content experience and/or suggest books and other content that might be of interest to you and your child.  You may enable your child to browse and/or shop in the NOOK store on the Barnes & Noble Websites.  If you do so, Barnes & Noble may collect information regarding items your child browses and/or purchases in order to make our services more interesting and useful to you.  Your child may also be able to post ratings and provide feedback regarding items available for purchase in the NOOK store on the Barnes & Noble Websites, and this information will be posted to Barnes & Noble Websites in the name of the master account holder.  Barnes & Noble may share the information it collects about your child with its affiliated companies to help to ensure that you have a superior shopping or browsing experience no matter where you choose to shop or browse within the Barnes & Noble enterprise.  Barnes & Noble may also share the information it collects about your child with third party service providers Barnes & Noble may engage to assist with services related to the Device and Barnes & Noble Websites.  These third party service providers are obligated to keep your information and your child's information confidential and must use the information only in connection with providing services to Barnes & Noble.  Additionally, your child may use NOOK software features to take notes or create other content on the Device.  Barnes & Noble may collect and store this information on Barnes & Noble servers for the purpose of providing a seamless user experience, but Barnes & Noble will not use such information for any other purpose without your consent. Please be advised that NOOK Media may operate Barnes & Noble's Kids Profile service in the future.   \r\nBarnes & Noble encourages parents and legal guardians to advise their children not to include any personally identifiable information such as first and last name or physical or email address when creating notes with NOOK software, posting ratings or feedback in the NOOK store or otherwise utilizing a Device.  Although Barnes & Noble does warn children not to include personally identifiable information in the notes they create or in the ratings they post, it is possible that a child may inadvertently provide Barnes & Noble with personally identifiable information in the context of such notes or ratings.  By creating a Kid's Profile, you agree if your child inadvertently provides personally identifiable information to Barnes & Noble that Barnes & Noble may collect and maintain that information.\r\nIf you are a parent or guardian believes your child under the age of 13 has submitted personal information or other information to Barnes & Noble without your consent, please contact privacy@barnesandnoble.com.  Once Barnes & Noble verifies that you are the parent or legal guardian, at your request, Barnes & Noble will promptly provide to you information regarding what, if any, personal information Barnes & Noble has collected about your child and how it has been used or shared.  Barnes & Noble will, at your request, remove personal information about your child from its database and instruct our affiliates and third party partners to do the same.  Barnes & Noble is committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage and use of personal information of children under the age of 13, including the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.    \r\nYour access rights and updates to your information\r\nYou have the right to ask us not to use your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
