We may also acquire Non-Personal Information about our users from \r\nexternal sources While you may use some of the functionality of WebMD without \r\nregistration, many of the specific tools and services on the WebMD Web Sites \r\nrequire that you register with WebMD.\r\nCookies and Web Beacons\r\nWe collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the WebMD Web Sites and \r\nyour use of other web sites through the use of \r\nCookies and Web Beacons. \"Cookies\" are small data files that are stored on \r\nthe hard drive of the computer you use to view a web site. Every computer that \r\naccesses the WebMD Web Sites is assigned a different cookie by WebMD. \"Web \r\nBeacons\" are graphic image files imbedded in a web page typically used to \r\nmonitor activity on a web page and send back to its home server (which can \r\nbelong to the host site, a network advertiser or some other third party) \r\ninformation from your browser, such as the IP address, the URL of the page on \r\nwhich the beacon is located, the type browser that is accessing the site and the \r\nID number of any Cookies on your computer previously placed by that server. \r\nThird parties under contract with WebMD may use Cookies or Web Beacons to \r\ncollect Non-Personal Information about your usage of the WebMD Web Sites, \r\nincluding which health topics you have viewed. These third party advertising \r\nservice providers may use this information, on our behalf, to help WebMD deliver \r\nadvertising on the WebMD Web Sites as well as on other sites on the Internet \r\nbased on your browsing activity on our sites. WebMD may further tailor the \r\nadvertising on these third party sites based on additional Non-Personal \r\nInformation to the extent known by WebMD or these third parties.\r\nMobile Device Applications (\"Apps\")\r\nWhen you download and install one of our WebMD Mobile Apps onto your mobile \r\ndevice we assign a random number to your App installation. This number cannot be \r\nused to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you personally unless \r\nyou choose to become a registered user of the App. We use this random number in \r\na manner similar to our use of Cookies as described in this Privacy Policy. \r\nUnlike Cookies, the random number is assigned to your installation of the App \r\nitself and not a browser, because the App does not work through your browser. \r\nTherefore the random number cannot be removed through settings. If you do not \r\nwant us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use Cookies, \r\nplease do not use the Mobile Device App, and please use your mobile device \r\nbrowser to access the WebMD Web Sites or our mobile optimized sites. We do not \r\nobtain any information about your mobile device, other than the brand, make and \r\nmodel and type of operating software your device uses. Please note that certain \r\nWebMD Mobile Apps require registration either to use the App or to use certain \r\nfunctionality in the App. \r\nWebMD's Apps obtain your consent (via an opt-in) before using information \r\nfrom pin-pointing technology like GPS or cell tower information. You can \r\nwithdraw your consent (opt-out) for the use of \"location\" by WebMD at any time \r\nby changing your location services in the \"Settings\" function on your mobile \r\ndevice. \r\nNon-Personal Information Collected by Third Parties Not Acting on WebMD's \r\nBehalf\r\nWe work with third parties to display advertising that reflects the interests \r\nand preferences of our user community. Sponsors or advertisers on the WebMD Web \r\nSites may use their own Cookies, Web Beacons or other online tracking \r\ntechnologies in the banner advertisements served on the WebMD Web Sites and in \r\nemails, special promotions or newsletters we send you. Their advertisements may \r\nbe displayed on the WebMD Web Sites or on other sites that you visit after you \r\nvisit the WebMD Web Sites. Some advertisers use companies other than WebMD to \r\nserve their ads and to monitor users' responses to ads, and these companies (\"Ad \r\nServers\") may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of Cookies \r\nor Web Beacons on the WebMD Web Sites. \r\nWe do not control how third parties use Cookies or Web Beacons or how they \r\nmanage the Non-Personal Information they gather through the use of these \r\ntechnologies on the WebMD Web Sites. However, we do require sponsors, \r\nadvertisers and Ad Servers who collect cookie or web beacon information through \r\nthe WebMD Web Sites to agree that they will not collect any Personal Information \r\nfrom the WebMD Web Sites without your consent. They have promised us they will \r\nnot link any Non-Personal Information collected by them on the WebMD Web Sites \r\nto Personal Information they or others collect in other ways or from other sites \r\nexcept as may be described in connection with a particular program.\r\nWhat Choices Do I Have?\r\nUpdating/Removing Your Personal Information\r\nIf you do not want your Personal Information used by WebMD as provided in \r\nthis Privacy Policy, you should not register as a member or for any specific \r\ntool or application that collects Personal Information.

If you reject our Cookies, certain of the functions and \r\nconveniences of the WebMD Web Sites may not work properly but you do not have to \r\naccept our Cookies in order to productively use the WebMD Web Sites. It is \r\nimportant to note that in order to use the opt-out services described below, \r\nsuch as the Network Advertising Initiative and the TRUSTed Ads Program, you must \r\nnot reject all Cookies because these opt-out procedures work by placing Cookies \r\non your browser that enable these opt-out procedures to function. The \"opt-out \r\nCookies\" are placed, for example, in order to help prevent the placement of \r\nCookies used for the targeting of advertising.\r\nCertain Ad Servers allow you to prevent them from collecting data through the \r\nuse of Cookies. In order to do so, you must Opt-out of such data collection with \r\neach individual site. Currently, you can opt out of Cookies for several Ad \r\nServers by visiting the\r\n\r\nNetwork Advertising Initiative gateway opt-out site or TRUSTe's Preference \r\nManager at http://preferences.truste.com/.
