provide services or to support aspects of our business on our behalf.\u00a0 In connection with those relationships, such third parties may collect data on our behalf.\u00a0 In that case, the third party would only collect and use such information as instructed by us and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.\r\nThird Party Use of Technologies:\u00a0 Third parties may set and access their own cookies, use their own web beacons, and use their own scripts on and through the SAY Media Services, on and through third-party websites, or in and through our emails and newsletters.\u00a0 How other

How We Protect Your Information\r\nSAY Media cares about the integrity and security of your personal information.\u00a0 We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to SAY Media or guarantee that your information on the SAY Media Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.\u00a0 The transmittal of information from you to us is done at your own risk.\r\nTo protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to any accounts maintained on the SAY Media Services.\u00a0 You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from SAY Media, at all times.\r\n7. Compromise of Personal Information\r\nIn the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, SAY Media will promptly notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise required by law.\r\n8. Your Choices About Your Information\r\nYou may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the Service, in which case SAY Media may not be able to provide certain services to you.\u00a0 You may update or correct your account information and email preferences at any time by adjusting your account settings or contacting us at privacy@saymedia.com.\u00a0 You can review and correct the information about you that SAY Media keeps on file by contacting us directly at privacy@saymedia.com.\u00a0\r\nIf you do not want SAY Media to gather non-personally identifiable information when you encounter advertisements we deliver through the SAY Media Services, please\u00a0click the opt-out link at the top of this Privacy Policy.\u00a0 The opt-out works by placing a flash cookie on your computer that notifies SAY Media that no other cookies should be placed on the applicable computer.\u00a0 If this cookie is deleted, then you will need to complete this opt-out process again.\u00a0 If you use more than one computer, you will need to complete this opt-out process on each computer that you use.\u00a0 The opt-out does not mean that you will no longer see online advertisements.\u00a0 It means only that advertisements delivered by SAY Media will not be targeted to you, based on information derived from cookies by SAY Media or its third-party vendors.\u00a0 \r\nYou can also limit targeted advertising by configuring your browser\u2019s settings or changing the management panel of the Adobe Flash Player to limit your acceptance of or delete cookies.\u00a0 Because the management of cookies in various browsers differs, you should consult the documentation for your browser in order to manage your cookies.\u00a0 In order to limit the acceptance of or disable \u201cflash\u201d cookies, you must access the management panel of the Adobe Flash Player installed on your computer.\u00a0 To learn more about the management panel of the Adobe Flash Player and the management of \u201cflash\u201d cookies, please access the following link: http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/index.html.\u00a0 You can also opt-out of receiving cookies from third-party data providers by following the instructions at:\u00a0 http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.\u00a0 TRUSTe also provides you with ways to opt-out of behavioral tracking at: http://preferences.truste.com/truste.\u00a0 You can opt-out of receiving cookies from Targusinfo, a specific third-party data provider, by following the instructions at:\u00a0 http://www.adadvisor.net/optout.html.\u00a0 Also, because your choices are not associated with you as a particular individual, if you change computers, web browsers or cookie settings, you will need to re-implement your preferences as described above.\u00a0 Note that if you limit or disable cookies, this does not mean that you will not see ads on the SAY Media Services. Instead, ads will be displayed that are based on passive browser information or other information that that may be provided by the SAY Media Services at the time of your visit.\r\n9. Children\u2019s Privacy\r\nProtecting the privacy of young children is especially important.\u00a0 SAY Media and its related websites are not structured to attract children under 13 years of age.\u00a0 SAY Media prohibits the use of our websites or services by anyone under 13 years of age.\u00a0 SAY Media does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register for any of the SAY Media Services.\u00a0 If you are under 13, please do not access the SAY Media Services or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.\u00a0 In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible.\u00a0 If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at privacy@saymedia.com.\r\n10. Links to Other Websites\r\nWe are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the SAY Media Services, nor the information or content contained therein.\u00a0 Please remember that when you use a link to go from within the SAY Media Services to an outside website, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect.\u00a0 Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on the SAY Media Services, is subject to that website\u2019s own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.\r\n11. Notification Procedures\r\nIt is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the applicable SAY Media website or service, as determined by SAY Media in its sole discretion. We reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Privacy Policy.\r\n12. Governing Law\r\nThis Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States of America.\r\n13. Changes to this Privacy Policy\r\nSAY Media may modify or update this Privacy Policy at its sole discretion from time to time, and so you should review this Privacy Policy periodically.\u00a0 When we change the policy in a material way, we will notify you by means of a notice on our website prior to the change becoming effective.\u00a0 Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.\u00a0 Your continued access to the SAY Media Services after the Privacy Policy has been modified and posted will signify your acceptance of such modifications.\u00a0\u00a0\r\nIf you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of the SAY Media Services, or your dealings with SAY Media, please contact us at privacy@saymedia.com or send mail to:\r\nSAY Media, Inc.\r\n180 Townsend Street\r\nSan Francisco, CA 94107\r\nAttention:\u00a0 Data Privacy\n    ",
