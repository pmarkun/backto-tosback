The following terms apply, in addition to and as part of the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy stated above and below, to users of the Mobile Services managed by Redcats USA for its brands.\r\n                        \r\n                        Although Redcats USA may not charge you for these Mobile Services, your mobile carrier's normal messaging, data, and other rates and fees will still apply to your use of the Mobile Services.\r\n                            In addition, downloading, installing, or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your mobile carrier, and not all Mobile Services may work with all carriers or devices.\r\n                            Therefore, you are responsible for checking with your mobile carrier to determine if the Mobile Services are available for your mobile devices, what restrictions, if any, may be applicable to your use of the Mobile Services, and how much they will cost you.\r\n                            By using the Mobile Services, you agree that Redcats USA may communicate with you by SMS, MMS, or other electronic means to your mobile device and that certain information about your usage of the Mobile Services may be communicated to Redcats USA.\r\n                            In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you agree promptly to update your mobile subscription account information to ensure that the messages Redcats USA intends to send to you are not sent to another person who acquires your former mobile telephone number.\r\n                        JURISDICTION AND GOVERNING LAW\r\n                        \r\n                            By visiting the Site, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Indiana, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and us related in any way to your use of the Site. This Site is intended for residents of the United States only. No software from this Site may be downloaded, exported or re-exported in violation of any law including, without limitation, to countries that are subject to U.S. export restrictions.\r\n                        \r\n                        ARBITRATION AGREEMENT\r\n                        \r\n                            Any dispute or claim relating in any way to products or services sold or distributed through the Site, or relating in any way to your use of the Site (including without limitation claims relating to the breach of the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy or the unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.  Unless you proceed with a small claims action, the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law will apply.\r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Terms of Use as a court would.\r\n                        \r\n                         \r\n                            If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration WE EACH HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. We also both agree that either of us may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.\r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Further, unless we both agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, consolidated or class proceeding.  If the requirements of this paragraph are found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void except for the waiver of any right to a jury trial described in the previous paragraph. \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            If a dispute arises between us, we strongly encourage you to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by contacting our Customer Support before resorting to arbitration or asserting a claim in small claims court.  We value our relationship with our customers and will try to resolve your claims informally and expeditiously.  To that end, before either of us may begin an arbitration proceeding, written notice must be sent to the other describing the claim.  If to us, the notice should be sent to \r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            Office of the General Counsel\r\n                            Redcats USA\r\n                            2300 Southeastern Ave.\r\n                            Indianapolis, IN 46201\r\n                            Email: GeneralCounsel@RedcatsUSA.com\r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            and if to you, at the current address you provided in your customer account.  If the claim has not been resolved within 30 days of sending the notice, either party may then commence an arbitration proceeding.   The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules and forms are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.  Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, we will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county or parish where you live or at another mutually agreed location.\r\n                        \r\n                        \r\n                            The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. If the arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of our last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if we did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then we will pay you the amount of the award or US$1,000, whichever is greater.\r\n                        \r\n                        TERMINATION\r\n                        \r\n                            All of the Terms of Use are material. Upon any breach by you of any such term, your right to access, download and otherwise use this Site, all materials obtained from this Site and all copies thereof shall immediately terminate.\r\n                        \r\n                        OTHER \r\n                        \r\n                            If any of the Terms of Use is unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that term shall be deemed severable from the other terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining terms. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between us relating to the subject matter herein. \r\n                        \r\n                        NOTIFYING US OF CLAIMED COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT\r\n                        \r\n                            If you wish to notify Redcats USA of an alleged copyright infringement for material posted on the Site, to be effective, your notice must be a written communication to our designated agent that complies with Section 512(c)(3) of the U.S. Copyright Act.

Your state, if it imposes a sales tax, may require that you report and pay the tax due on your purchase. Details of how to file a state sales or use tax return may be found on your state's department of revenue website. \r\n                       \r\n                    ",
