Each company or organization on Yammer lives in a separate Network that assures the privacy of its Members and the User Content posted in that Network. Here\u2019s how it works:\nYour Network is defined by your company or organization\u2019s email domain. For example, all users who sign up with a \u201cmegacorp.com\u201d email address would be part of the megacorp.com network. To join a Network, you must confirm your email address.\nOnly the people in your Network can view the Member profiles and feeds.\nUsers can require anyone else in their Network to re-confirm their email address at any time to prove they still belong in that Network. You can use this feature to remove former colleagues. Network administrators can also remove a user at any time.\nWe don\u2019t share your private information with advertisers. This includes your email address and the email addresses of others in your Network.\nCompanies can impose additional security requirements for their networks, such as secure sessions, password policies, and restricting access to the IP range of their VPN.\nCompanies who claim their network own the User Content created by their employees. Until that point, Users own their own User Content. Yammer does not own User Content. Network Administrators can request that messages posted to their Network be securely exported to a company designated destination for archival and backup purposes.\nYammer\u2019s administrative tools do not allow our employees to view messages in a Network. Access to our database is granted only to our technicians on a case-by-case basis to troubleshoot specific technical issues, or as may be required by law. Each such instance is logged.\nYammer has instituted measures to protect the security of each Network\u2019s data.\n\u00a0\nPlease click here for the full details of our privacy practices.\n\nClick here to hide details.\nThis privacy policy was last modified on February 25, 2011.\nWelcome to www.yammer.com (\u00e2\u0080\u009cWebsite\u00e2\u0080\u009d). We are happy that you have chosen to visit our Website and learn more about our company. Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use personally identifiable information (\u00e2\u0080\u009cPersonal Information\u00e2\u0080\u009d) that you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Website. We will not use or share your Personal Information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.\nIn this Privacy Policy the term \u00e2\u0080\u009cwww.yammer.com\u00e2\u0080\u009d refers to our Website, the homepage of which is located at www.yammer.com; the terms \u00e2\u0080\u009cus\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cour\u00e2\u0080\u009d refers to Yammer, Inc. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cYammer\u00e2\u0080\u009d), the owner of www.yammer.com, and the terms \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cuser\u00e2\u0080\u009d refer to the user or viewer of www.yammer.com. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning ascribed to them in our Terms of Use.\nWhen using Yammer, there are general elements of our service that you should know. First, your network of contacts is defined by your company or organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s email domain. To join a network, you must confirm your email address and it must match the email domain of your company. Additionally, only people in your network can view other member profiles and feeds. Companies that \u00e2\u0080\u009cclaim\u00e2\u0080\u009d their network can impose additional security requirements beyond those described in this Privacy Policy. Examples of such restrictions include secure sessions, password policies and restricting access to the internal protocol range of their virtual private network. Additionally, companies that claim their network own the user generated content of their employees. Yammer does not own such user generated content and network administrators can request that user generated content posted to their network be securely exported to a company designated destination for archival and backup purposes. Yammer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s administrative tools do not allow our employees to view messages in a network.

In requesting your participation in these surveys we may ask you to provide you name and email address to us.\n\nUser Content\nOur Website offers its users the opportunity to share User Content \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for instance, on bulletin boards and blogs and in chat rooms. If you choose to use these features, you should be aware that any Personal Information you submit through these features can be read, collected, or used by other viewers of these forums and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.

A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. Yammer employs the use of both \u00e2\u0080\u009csession\u00e2\u0080\u009d cookies and \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersistent\u00e2\u0080\u009d cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Website. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.\nWhen you visit our Website, our computer may ask your computer for permission to employ the use of a session or persistent cookie. Our Website will then send a cookie to your browser if your browser\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits our Website to access the cookies it has already sent to you and not the cookies sent to you by other websites.\nMost web browsers can be adjusted to inform you when a cookie has been sent to you and provide you with the opportunity to refuse that cookie. However, refusing a cookie may, in some cases, preclude you from using, or negatively impact the display or function of, our Website or certain areas or features of our Website.\n\nClear GIFs\nWe may also use \u00e2\u0080\u009cClear GIFs\u00e2\u0080\u009d (aka \u00e2\u0080\u009cweb beacons\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cpixel tags\u00e2\u0080\u009d) or similar technologies in our Website and/or in our communications with you. A Clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image located on a web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which helps us to verify an individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s viewing or receipt of a web page or message. Clear GIFs allow us to know whether you have viewed a web page prior to visiting our Website and may enable us to relate such information to other information, including your Personal Information. We use information provided from Clear GIFs to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Yammer better for our users.\n\nIP Address and Clickstream Data\nOur servers automatically collect data about your Internet Protocol address when you visit us.

We use this information for internal system administration, to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Website. Such information may also be used to gather broad demographic information, such as country of origin and Internet Service Provider. We may also link this information with Personal Information.\nAny or all of these activities with regard to the above-described Website Usage Information may be performed on our behalf by our third-party service providers. (See\u00c2\u00a0third-parties\u00c2\u00a0Sharing Information with Third Parties\u00c2\u00a0section below).\nRights to Opt In/Opt Out\nYou have the right to \u00e2\u0080\u009copt in\u00e2\u0080\u009d and/or \u00e2\u0080\u009copt out\u00e2\u0080\u009d of certain of our uses of your Personal Information.
