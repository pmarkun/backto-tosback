Our primary goal in collecting information from \r\n\t\t\t\t\tyou is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using our site. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tPersonally Identifiable Information\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. Personal information is requested when you register \r\n\t\t\t\t\tand set up an account, order a product or service, register for a Gift List, enter contests or sweepstakes, apply for the Buy.com \r\n\t\t\t\t\tcredit card, fill out surveys, and send us feedback. For example, this information might include your name, billing address, shipping \r\n\t\t\t\t\taddress, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other payment information, and product details. With this information, \r\n\t\t\t\t\tBuy.com can fill your orders and better provide you with personalized services. For a few services, we may collect your personal \r\n\t\t\t\t\tinformation on behalf of other merchants and share it with them. For example, on our Cellular Store, we may ask you for your social \r\n\t\t\t\t\tsecurity number, driver's license number and date of birth and share that information with the third-party telephone service provider \r\n\t\t\t\t\tthat you have selected. If you visit one of the stores available through a link on our site, they will independently collect, use and \r\n\t\t\t\t\tshare your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. If you have questions about their information practices, \r\n\t\t\t\t\tplease read their privacy policies. In many cases, you can find a link to their privacy policies on the page offering the Partners' services. \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNon-Personally Identifiable Information\r\n\t\t\t\t\tThis refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. We gather certain information about you based \r\n\t\t\t\t\tupon where you shop on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t For example, this information may include the Web site's Uniform Resource Locator (\"URL\") that you just came from, which URL you next\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other \r\n\t\t\t\t\t  resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control \r\n\t\t\t\t\t  Protocol/Internet Protocol (\"TCP/IP\") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol \r\n\t\t\t\t\t  to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is \r\n\t\t\t\t\t  automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web, allowing web servers to locate and identify \r\n\t\t\t\t\t  your computer. Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet, browse and shop. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOn an aggregated basis, we collect anonymous data related to the pages, products, downloads and other content that is sampled, \r\n\t\t\t\t\tclicked on, streamed, searched for, transferred from and downloaded. Except as otherwise limited in this Policy, we may \r\n\t\t\t\t\tdisclose, sell, trade, or rent Non-Personally Identifiable Information to others without your consent. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhere do we collect information from you and how do we use it?\r\n\t\t\t\t\tOur primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide Buy.com's visitors with a superior customized online experience. We use the customer contact information to fill orders, contact purchasers to inform them of their order status, to send promotional information, to enhance the operation of our site and administer our systems. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDemographic data also may be collected at our site from third party advertising servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents who provide us with the zip code and area code associated with a visitor's server, along with pages viewed on our site. We review the actions of the Buy.com visitors on an aggregate basis to determine customers' preferences. Buy.com also does research on our visitors' demographics, interests, and pages viewed based on the information provided to us during ordering, a promotion, from our server log files, from our web site analysis agents, or from contests, drawings or surveys. We will use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze site use, to improve our product offerings, and to customize our site's content, layout, and services. We receive reports from third party ad servers, content servers, or web site analysis agents that tells us how many ads were presented and clicked upon or what content was served or viewed. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWe may also share your personally identifiable information with third parties who provide services to us, our customers and web site visitors. Those third parties include authorized contractors, temporary employees and consultants and other companies working with us (collectively, \"agents\").

This information is subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy except as explained here. Others will be able to search for your Gift List using your e-mail address unless you choose not to make your Gift List searchable. Those who have access to your Gift List will be able to see your name, e-mail address, city, state, and may have access to other personal information and product information that you have entered into the Gift List. If others place orders for items on your Gift List, they may have access to your address. We will use the product preferences that you include in your Gift List to inform you about offers that may be of interest to you. If you provide us with the e-mail addresses of your family and friends, we will use their e-mail addresses to send them your Gift List if you instruct us to. With your permission, we will send them the Gift List using your e-mail address as the originating address. We will not use the e-mail addresses of your family and friends for any other purpose. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGift Certificates\r\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you purchase a gift certificate from our site, you will give us the recipient's name and e-mail address if you wish to send the certificate by e-mail.

We use a third party to fulfill your Cellular Store orders. We may use and transfer to our Cellular Store fulfillment partners and the cellular telephone service provider such information together with your other personal information as needed to fulfill any orders that you may place. The cellular telephone service providers may use and share that information in accordance with their own privacy policies. Please review the privacy policy of your cellular telephone service provider to understand how such information may be used and disclosed by such cellular telephone service provider. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDigital Downloads\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen you order a download or a product from us, we collect personally identifiable information from you. We collect and maintain your such personally identifiable information as your name, e-mail address, billing and shipping address, company name, company, home, facsimile and shipping contact telephone numbers, music selections, credit card or other payment information, order number, referring URL, IP address, page you bought from and a password. We collect this, and other information, as disclosed in this Policy, in order to deliver the download, ship products to you, to pay royalties and license fees, to administer our site and to send you promotional materials. When you download a digital file or other digital content, there are broad but necessary limits placed upon how you may copy, use and transfer that download to approved computers, electronic devices and media. In the future, those limits might be extended in exchange for your agreement to allow use of your Personally Identifiable Information in creative ways (e.g. download a sponsor's screensaver to your cellphone or other electronic devices).

As a condition of receiving any prize, you will be required to submit an Affidavit of Eligibility, for us to ensure that you are eligible to receive the prize according to the Contest Rules. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tNewsletters,Promotional E-mails and Personalized On-line Ads\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWe offer free newsletters, such as our Buy.com magazine, promotional e-mails and personalized on-line advertisements as a service to our customers.

We encourage you to promptly update your information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past purchases, you cannot delete information associated with past purchases. Also, as a security measure we \"back up\" the data stored on our systems, and such prior information cannot be completely removed from our databases.

They receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information and to process and ship your order. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\tWithin Buy.com, your information is kept on password protected, limited access servers.

Without collecting any personally identifiable information, they use that data to tell us (and other advertisers) which ads are the most effective on particular sites.
