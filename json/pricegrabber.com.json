You agree that you will not take any action that imposes an unreasonable or disproportionately large load\n        on PriceGrabber's computer systems or communications infrastructure. You agree that you will not use any\n        software robot, spider, other automatic device or manual process to monitor or copy Site pages or the content\n        contained therein without PriceGrabber's prior written consent.\n    \u00a0\n        MERCHANT REVIEWS\n    \u00a0You may submit a merchant review through the Merchant Ratings System on the Site or through the\n        Shopper Satisfaction Survey to describe your shopping experiences with merchants.\n    \n    You may submit a merchant review only in good faith and about a merchant from whom you have actually\n            purchased or attempted to purchase products, limited to where you have (i) completed the ordering process,\n            (ii) exchanged payment data, and/or (iii) received an invoice number.\n        \n        You agree to submit the corresponding and legitimate invoice number or equivalent confirmation of order\n            number/identifier when submitting the merchant review (\"Invoice Number\"). You acknowledge and agree that the\n            Invoice Number will be made available by PriceGrabber to the applicable merchant in conjunction with your\n            review, and accordingly, the merchant may be able to contact you regarding your review or otherwise.\n        \n        You may only describe your experience with the merchant for which you are writing a merchant review. You\n            should not review any merchant on situations that are not controlled by the merchant you are reviewing.\n        \n        You may submit no more than one merchant review of a particular merchant in any thirty (30) day period.\n        Any merchant review that you submit is subject to the conditions and restrictions described in the CONTENT\n            SUBMISSION section, above.\n        \n        You acknowledge and agree that PriceGrabber may, in its sole discretion, post only the first ten (10)\n            merchant reviews it receives from users (which may not include your review) that are related, on a case by\n            case basis and in whole or in part, to a product or service listing error by a merchant, such as, but not\n            limited to, an error in the price of a product(s) or a service, the number of units of a product(s)\n            available for a certain price, the shipping rates for product(s), or inventory levels.\n        \n    \u00a0Upon becoming aware of the same, PriceGrabber will omit any merchant review that it determines\n        on the face of the review (only) violates any requirements in this Terms of Use or the Member Agreement.\n        PriceGrabber will not itself edit or modify the contents of a merchant review; it will only remove a review in\n        accordance with the foregoing.\n    \u00a0By providing the Invoice Number, you acknowledge and agree that you may be contacted by\n        PriceGrabber and/or the applicable merchant to which/whom the invoice relates. You acknowledge and agree that\n        your review may not be displayed if the Invoice Number does not match the associated information in\n        PriceGrabber's records. A merchant may dispute the validity of an invoice identified by you and may submit a\n        complaint to PriceGrabber. This may result in PriceGrabber opening a user review inquiry. During the user review\n        inquiry, PriceGrabber may, in its sole discretion, remove the contested review, and/or require additional data\n        or proof from the user to determine whether the review should remain or be reinstated on the Site.

In order to provide you with the Services you request,\n        PriceGrabber may require that you first provide certain personal information, which we determine is reasonably\n        necessary in order for us to fulfill your request. If you indicate an interest in participating in a Service, we\n        will identify what specific personal information you must provide prior to collecting such information.

In addition, PriceGrabber may transmit information\n        to a merchant, such as an invoice number, which may permit the merchant to deduce the identity of a\n        user/reviewer in the event that a merchant disputes a user review on the grounds that a transaction never took\n        place between the user and the merchant and/or an order was never made by the user in each case for the\n        applicable product(s)/service(s).\n    \u00a0\n        In certain instances, PriceGrabber may request that you provide secondary information (e.g., demographic\n        information), which we may use, for example, to learn more about our customers and to develop and improve our\n        services.
