TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third-party, is to accelerate online trust among consumer and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovate trust solutions. If you have questions or complaints regarding our Policy or practices, please contact us at privacy@opendns.com or write to us at Privacy Matters, OpenDNS, Inc., 145 Bluxome Street, San Francisco, CA 94107. If you are not satisfied with our response you can contact TRUSTe here.\n\n\tEU Safe Harbor Statement\n\n\tThe United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be provided to Personal Information transferred from the European Economic Area to the United States (the \"U.S.-EU Safe Harbor\"). Consistent with our commitment to protecting personal privacy, OpenDNS adheres to the principles set forth in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certificate, please visit\u00a0http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.\n\n\tInformation You Provide Us\n\n\tIn order to provide you with the Services we may ask you for Personally Identifiable Information (\"Personal Information\"). Personal Information includes but is not limited to your name and email address. Depending on the Services you request, Personal Information may also include addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, credit card information, usernames, passwords, and other information you provide voluntarily that may be considered Personal Information. OpenDNS collects and uses such information only insofar as is it deems reasonably necessary in order to provide our Services, for us to manage and send you notices regarding your account, and for us to send you notices regarding the Services. Subject to compliance with applicable law or contractual obligations, this information will be stored for as long as necessary to provide these Services plus a reasonable time thereafter to comply with our archiving and restoration policies.\n\n\tIf you email us through any of the contact us links on our Website, if you submit a request for information through our Website or if you submit a support ticket through our Website we may ask you for Personal Information including but not limited to your name and email address in order to respond to your questions, comments and requests. If you choose to correspond with us via email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our correspondence with you.\n\n\tIf you participate in an OpenDNS referral program such as our tell a friend program, you may provide us with your friend's email address and any Personal Information that you voluntarily include in your email message to your friend or to OpenDNS. We use such information to send a one-time email to your friend regarding OpenDNS and our services and products. We store the information for the purpose of tracking the success of the referral program.\n\n\tService Usage Information\n\n\tWhen you use our Services, OpenDNS stores certain DNS, IP address and related information about you to improve the quality of our Service, to provide you with Services and for internal business and analysis purposes. For example, OpenDNS runs a Domain Name System (DNS) service. DNS translates a domain name (e.g., http://www.example.com) into the corresponding numerical address (e.g., 192.0.34.166) that allows your system to access the domain over the network.\n\n\tCookies, Clear GIFs, Clickstream and Browser Information\n\n\tWe may use \"cookies\" on or in conjunction with our Websites to help OpenDNS identify and track visitors, their usage of our Websites, and their website access preferences. A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. If you do not wish to have cookies placed on your computer you should set your browser to refuse cookies before using the Websites, with the drawback that certain features of the Websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on our Websites.\n\n\tOpenDNS does not control cookies in third-party ads, and you are encouraged to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of cookies and other technology. The ads appearing on our Websites may be delivered to you by third-party advertising companies.\n\n\tOur third-party advertising partners employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our Website by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to your Personal Information.\n\n\tWe may receive, collect and store certain other types of information whenever you interact with us and our Websites, including, without limitation, your Internet Protocol address, your domain name, the pages you visit on the Websites; other information such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, the date and time of each visitor request and any search terms you have entered on our Website or a referral website; and other web usage activity and data logged by our web servers. OpenDNS uses this information to better understand how OpenDNS' visitors use its Websites and for internal system and website administration. We do not tie this information to your Personal Information.\n\n\tWe may use third-party cookies as part of remarketing activities we conduct with Google and/or other third-party vendors, to help provide you with relevant promotional offers as you use the Internet. As part of these remarketing activities, these third-party cookies may record your visits to our Websites and web sites visited prior to using our Websites. Such cookies can then be used to serve advertisements to you on other web sites. You may choose to be exempt from the use of Google remarketing cookies at the Google advertising privacy page. Alternatively, you may opt-out of remarketing on the Google network and similar networks at the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page. Opting out will not prevent advertisements from being served to you on the Internet; it will only affect advertisements that utilize remarketing cookies to serve advertisements on the specified advertising networks. We are not responsible for the activities of other parties that may not comply with your opt-out requests.\n\n\tChat Rooms, Discussion Forums, Bulletin Boards\n\n\tIf you participate in one of our chat rooms, discussion forums, or post messages to a Website bulletin board, you should be aware that the information disclosed and shared will be broadly available to other persons, both inside of and/or outside of OpenDNS, who have access to that chat room, forum or bulletin board. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online by not posting any more Personal Information than you want revealed. In addition, if you post Personal Information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Please also note that a participant's expressed opinion is his or her own and should not be considered to reflect the opinion of OpenDNS. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at contact@opendns.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.\n\n\tUse and Disclosure of Personal Information\n\n\tOpenDNS does not share, rent, trade or sell your Personal Information with third parties, except as described in this Policy. If you do provide us with Personal Information, we will only use it for the purposes described where it is collected or to deliver the Services you requested, and we will not sell, license, transmit or disclose this information outside of OpenDNS unless (1) you expressly authorize us to do so, (2) it is necessary to allow our trusted service providers or agents (such as address list hosting companies, advertising and analytic companies, billing service providers, email service providers, search providers, security providers, and other similar service providers) to provide products or services for us or you, (3) it is disclosed to entities that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other entities with whom we have joint marketing agreements, (4) it is necessary in connection with a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of OpenDNS or the merger of OpenDNS into another entity or any consolidation, share exchange, combination, reorganization, or like transaction in which OpenDNS is not the survivor, or (5) otherwise as we are required or permitted by law. Also, we reserve the right to fully use and disclose any information that is not Personal Information (such as statistics, most frequented domains, phishing attempts blocked by our Services).\n\n\tIf you send us a request, inquiry, feedback or other comments (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to edit and republish it in our Knowledge Base, which is displayed on our Websites, in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users with similar issues.\n\n\tWe post customer testimonials on our Websites which may contain Personal Information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. If you wish to request that your testimonial be removed you may contact us at contact@opendns.com.\n\n\tUpdating, Correcting or Deleting Personal Information and OpenDNS Accounts\n\n\tYou may correct, update, or delete your Personal Information by accessing it through the edit account information page or by emailing our Customer Support at contact@opendns.com. If emailing Customer Support, please allow us a reasonable period of time in order to satisfy your request.\n\n\tOpt-Out\n\n\tIn connection with promotions or other projects, we may ask you specifically whether you have objections with respect to a certain kind of data use or sharing. If you opt-out under such circumstances, we will respect your decision. To opt out of receiving commercial communications from OpenDNS, please click on the \"opt-out\" or \"unsubscribe\" link in the communication or please contact us at contact@opendns.com. Your e-mail address will be removed from our marketing list. Please allow us a reasonable period of time in order to satisfy your request, as some promotions may already be in process.\n\n\tThird-Party Websites\n\n\tFor your convenience, we may provide links to other websites and web pages that we do not control. This Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that OpenDNS does not own or control, or to individuals that OpenDNS does not employ or manage. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from OpenDNS websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and OpenDNS is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.\n\n\tPrivacy of Minors\n\n\tOpenDNS recognizes the privacy interests of children and we encourage parents and guardians to take an active role in their children's online activities and interests. Our Websites and Services are not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13.\n\n\tData Security\n\n\tWe restrict access to Personal Information collected about you at our Websites to our employees, our affiliates' employees, those who are otherwise specified in this Policy, or others who need to know that information to provide the Services to you or in the course of conducting our business operations or activities. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). While no website can guarantee security, we maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information collected via the website. We protect our databases with various physical, technical and procedural measures and we restrict access to your information by unauthorized persons. We also advise all OpenDNS employees about their responsibility to protect customer data and we provide them with appropriate guidelines for adhering to our company's business ethics standards and confidentiality policies. Inside OpenDNS, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access.\n\n\tVisiting our Website from Outside of the United States\n\n\tIf you are visiting our Websites from outside of the United States or otherwise contacting us from outside of the United States, please be aware that your Personal Information may be transferred to, stored or processed in the United States, where many of our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, but please be assured that we take steps to protect your privacy. By using our Services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Policy.\n\n\tPrivacy Policy Changes\n\n\tWe reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. We will post those changes to this privacy statement on the home page and other places we deem appropriate, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. This Policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or other legal right in or on behalf of any party.\n\n\tGeneral Terms and Conditions of Use\n\n\tThe terms of this Policy are incorporated into our general terms of use. Please review our terms of use at\u00a0http://www.opendns.com/terms/.\n\n\tEffective Date of This Privacy Policy\n\n\tThis Privacy Policy was first effective as of July 22, 2007.\n\tThis Privacy Policy was last updated on November 12, 2012.\n\nvar _gaq = _gaq || [];\nsetTimeout(\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', '60_seconds', 'read'])\",60000);\n",
