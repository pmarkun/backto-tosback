This includes for example but is not limited to: abuse of an email account or dialup add-on which is part of a customer's account but which is used by a third party or abuse of a colocated server or colocation services by a third party, with or without the account owner's permission.\n\n  Enforcement and remedy: \nViolation of any terms set forth in this Acceptable Use Policy may result in one or more of the following, at the discretion of Sonic.net, Inc.:\n\n Issuance of a warning\n Temporary suspension of service\n Billing to defray administrative costs incurred\n Termination of your services, account or accounts\n Legal action\nIf any activities or security problems involving a Sonic.net account or Sonic.net, Inc. customer's services cause network outages, the owner of the account or service will be billed for network down-time.\nAny account owner whose account is terminated for violation of the terms set forth in this Acceptable Use Policy will be required to pay any outstanding balances due, including any and all early termination fees. In instances where it is necessary to terminate a customer's account, an administrative disconnect fee may also be applied.\nSonic.net, Inc. will normally attempt to contact any user in violation of this Acceptable Use Policy before taking action, but depending on the circumstances or the severity of the violation action may be taken without prior notification. In this case, the user will be notified as soon as it is practicable.\n\n  No limitation \nThis acceptable use policy in no way limits the rights and remedies of Sonic.net, Inc.

Sonic.net, Inc. reserves the right to terminate idle connections, that is, connections that have been unused for 15 minutes. Personal accounts are limited to one login at any given time.\nSonic.net, Inc. provides unlimited Internet access to its dial-up customers. \"Unlimited Internet access\" is defined as un-metered, on-demand dial-up access; this is different from dedicated (\"always-on\") access. In order to ensure that dial-up services remain available to all dial-up customers, Sonic.net, Inc. reserves the right to terminate any dial-up connection that exceeds twelve consecutive hours duration.\nSonic.net, Inc. assumes that anyone consistently using a dial-up connection for more than twelve consecutive hours at a time will need dedicated-line access.

Sonic.net, Inc. also offers several high-speed, dedicated (\"always on\") account types. Please see our sales page at http://www.sonic.net/sales for more information.\n\n  WiFi Network Sharing Policy \nFor Sonic.net services where customer premise equipment is provided, owned and managed by Sonic.net, that equipment may be used at some point in the future to provide WiFi access to others. If and when this is offered, it will be secured and separate from your own traffic and your local area network, and would provide limited access to guest users. Your own traffic would have priority. A mechanism for opting out will be provided if and when this feature is launched.\n\n  Technical Support Policy \nThe function of the Sonic.net, Inc. technical support staff is to assist customers with initial connection, Internet browser and email account setup. Support is only available for computers running recent versions of Macintosh or Windows operating systems. Sonic.net, Inc. does not offer over-the-phone tech support for issues such as cgi programming, Linux use, your web site, or any other issue not directly related to your dialing software or to the basic functions of your web browser and email program. While at its discretion the support staff may sometimes assist our customers with non-connectivity or non-email issues, any such extra service is strictly 'added value' service and provision of such service does not obligate Sonic.net, Inc. to continue to provide such service. Sonic.net, Inc. also provides some online discussion groups (web forums) here; these are an excellent resource and answers to many questions that lie outside of the Sonic.net, Inc. support model may be found in these forums.\nSonic.net, Inc. will use its best efforts to provide all services to get your computer connected to the Internet but can not be held responsible for hardware or software malfunctions or assist in servicing or repairing your equipment. In such cases, the technical support staff will gladly refer you to outside sources for assistance.
