We may personalize the advertising that you are shown on our sites or other sites with which we have a business relationship.

Examples include hosting our web servers,  analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card  payments, and providing customer service.   These companies and individuals may be located in a country whose data  protection legislation is different from your country, and they will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party or use that data for any other purpose.  We will remain responsible for any information shared in this way. 2.  We may disclose such  information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if  you make your resume searchable, then all parties with access to our searchable  resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. If you  indicate by configuring your profile that you would like to receive information  about the opportunities, products or services of third parties, we supply your  contact information to select third parties such as employers, recruiters, data  aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or  otherwise communicating with you.  We use  data we have about you (such as the interests and preferences you have  expressed) to determine whether you might be interested in the opportunities,  products or services of a particular third party. \r\n\r\nWe also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to the Sites with Monster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clients, partners, other Site visitors, and other third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the Sites and how those visitors use the Sites in order to serve advertisements to you on our Sites or other sites with which we have a business relationship. We may also aggregate on an anonymous basis data regarding job qualifications, schooling, age, experience level or other information relevant to the job search or competition among job seekers for any such job. Such aggregated data does not identify users individually, and may be made available to employers or fellow job seekers or community members.  We supply technology, hosting, hiring management and related services to other  leading companies to power recruitment areas on their Web sites (sometimes  referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cHosted Career Sites\u00e2\u0080\u009d).

We disclose information  if legally required to do so, or at our discretion pursuant to a request from a governmental entity or  if we believe in good faith \u00e2\u0080\u0093 after considering your privacy interests and  other factors \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal  requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property  or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security;  or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.  Because Monster Worldwide, Inc. is a US company and information collected on our  Sites is stored in whole or in part in the United   States, your information may become subject to U.S. law.4.  We may disclose and  transfer such information to a third party who acquires any or all of Monster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business units, whether such acquisition is by way of merger,  consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In  addition, in the event Monster becomes the subject of an insolvency proceeding,  whether voluntary or involuntary, Monster or its liquidator, administrator,  receiver or administrative receiver may sell, license or otherwise dispose of  such information in a transaction approved by the court.

If you are worried  about being identified, you should not include specific details by which you  could be identified. If you use a  confidential resume to apply to a job online, the employer to whom you send  your resume will be able to view your contact information in order to contact  you about your application.If you allow your resume to be searchable without making it  confidential, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database  (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume.\u00c2\u00a0 Employers or other parties with access to our  searchable resume database may be located in countries whose data protection  legislation may not be equivalent to the laws in your country.\u00c2\u00a0 For example, your resume may be viewed and  accessed by employers outside the European Economic Area who have access to our  searchable database. By making your resume searchable, you are expressly  consenting to such transfers of data.We  attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database to legitimate users such  as paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters and human  resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and national security  agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not gain access to this  database.

We cannot control the retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles  that have been downloaded by third parties.\u00c2\u00a0  Accordingly, you should not put sensitive information, personality  profiles, or other information you would not want made public, in your resume.If you provide us with details of a reference, it is your responsibility  to ensure that the person is aware that you have forwarded his/her details and  has consented in writing for you to do so.If you use our facilities to build a resume or to post a resume in  our database of jobseekers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 resumes, then you will be providing us with  personal data we will use in accordance with this Statement.

Monster has no control over, and is not responsible for, the practices of those third party advertisers. Monster encourages you to review the policies of such advertisers.    You will find additional information about the following third party ad servers at www.doubleclick.com; www.atlassolutions.com/privacy; and www.omniture.com/en/privacy.  We use other third party ad servers as well; a way to opt out of third party cookies is to modify your browser settings to decline cookies as described at the end of this statement. You may also click here to see a list of many of the companies that Monster works with in connection with serving personalized ads. Otherwise, if you do not wish to allow your session visitation information on our Sites to be aggregated and analyzed by Omniture, or used by Omniture to tailor dynamic content to your specific interests, you may utilize the following opt out mechanism  www.omniture.com/en/privacy/policy#optout.    We use persistent cookies and related technologies (such as web beacons described below) to determine and track direct and indirect candidate application traffic  in response to Job Postings either on Monster or on the websites of third parties through Monster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Career-Ad-Network (described below). We also allow persistent third party cookies as part of online advertising campaigns to determine and track site traffic landing from Monster\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advertising banners that have been placed on the websites of third parties. The data collected via these cookies is anonymous and the information is not linked to your personally identifiable information without your permission. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersistent\u00e2\u0080\u009d cookies placed by our third party ad servers will remain on your computer after you have left our site for up to 20 years unless you choose to delete them.     We also use \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersistent\u00e2\u0080\u009d cookies in connection with our Career Ad Network (\u00e2\u0080\u009cCAN\u00e2\u0080\u009d). The CAN cookie is used to display relevant job ads to you on Monster and when you visit other web sites. The information collected by the CAN cookie is treated in accordance with the policies and practices described in our Privacy Statement above. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cpersistent\u00e2\u0080\u009d cookie we use in CAN will remain on your computer after you have left our site and will expire six months after it was set.     You have the ability to update or opt-out of the CAN cookie by clicking on the following link: http://can.monster.com/cookie-technology.aspx. Monster enforces your opt-out of CAN by setting a \u00e2\u0080\u009cblocking cookie\u00e2\u0080\u009d. In order for the blocking cookie to work on your computer, your browser must be set to accept third party cookies. The blocking cookie for CAN will last for five years; however, if you delete your browser cookies, your opt-out cookie, as well as any updates you may have made, will also be deleted. In addition, your opt-out only applies in the browser you are using at the time you opt-out and only on the computer you are using at such time. If you buy a new computer, change web browsers or delete this cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out task again. Opting-out of the CAN cookie does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising from CAN. It does mean that the ads delivered to you by CAN will no longer be tailored to your Web browsing patterns. Once you opt-out CAN no longer maintains a targeting cookie on your computer, so the ads will be general in nature and could be repetitive.       This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cGoogle\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Google Analytics uses \u00e2\u0080\u009ccookies\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.     You have the ability to accept or decline cookies at any time by modifying your browser settings. See below for instructions.  If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on the web site.     Additionally, Monster uses \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlash cookies\u00e2\u0080\u009d, also known as \u00e2\u0080\u009cLocal Shared Objects\u00e2\u0080\u009d, to preserve video player settings and for user authentication purposes. You can adjust your settings for your Flash cookies here.     Web Beacons:  Monster Web pages and the Web pages of our partners also utilize electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs, clear gifs or action tags) that allow us to collect certain information about users\u00e2\u0080\u0099 visits to these Web pages (including the number of users who have visited those pages), measure and improve the effectiveness of advertisements and job postings, and deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable information; they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about web site usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of page view and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. This information may be shared with third party processors for processing on behalf of Monster, as well as with clients, partners, and other third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the Web pages, how those visitors use those Web Pages, and the effectiveness of their advertisements and job postings.   (You will find information about a current third-party processor used by Monster at www.atlassolutions.com. We may use other third party processors as well.)    Because Web beacons are the same as any other content request included in the recipe page, you cannot opt out or refuse them. However, they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or changing the cookie setup in your browser.    JavaScript:  Monster also uses JavaScript, for example, within certain advertisements. JavaScript is a script language that enhances the functionality of websites, particularly in respect to pictures. We are not collecting any personal data via JavaScript but use it to inform employers about how many applicants have clicked on email addresses embedded in their job ads, for example. You may deactivate JavaScript via your browser settings or activate it the same way. If you disable JavaScript you will not be able to use some of the functions of the website.    Thank you for using Monster.    Update effective 23 August 2010    \u00a0 \r\n            Instructions for removing cookiesThe main browser types are listed below.
