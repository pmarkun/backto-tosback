Nada. Zilch. Zero.When you use Ixquick, we do not record your IP address, we do not record which browser you are using (Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, etc.), we do not record your computer platform (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.), and we do not record your search words or phrases. In fact, the only information we do record is an aggregate total of how many searches are performed on our website each day (a measure of overall traffic), and those overall traffic numbers broken down by language.Our zero data collection policy protects your privacy, since your IP address, browser, and platform information can be combined with other data to uniquely identify your computer, your location, or you. It is also important not to record search terms, since they can convey personal information as well. (Think of someone entering their own name and/or social security number.)\nCookies\nCookies are small pieces of data that are sent and saved to your computer's hard drive when visiting sites.\nIxquick uses only one anonymous cookie called \"preferences\". This cookie is to remember the search preferences you saved for your next visit. It expires after 90 days.\nYou can choose to accept or refuse cookies by changing the settings of your browser. It should be noted, however, that your Ixquick.com preferences will not work properly if your cookies are turned off. It is possible to accept cookies from selected sites only.\nYou can periodically delete cookies from your computer's hard drive, clearing out all historical data that may have been saved from your previous web surfing. If you delete cookies, you will not be recognized as a repeat visitor or viewer when returning to a site.To promote a cookie-free internet, Ixquick has recently launched a URL generator which eradicates the need for setting a cookie. It remembers your settings in a privacy friendly manner. It can be found at the bottom of the SETTINGS page.External Links\nAs a search engine, and as an advertising publisher, you will find various links on our site, including but not limited to search results and sponsored results. These sites are owned and maintained by independent companies, over which Ixquick has no control, and who are not covered by this privacy policy. Ixquick is not liable or responsible for the content of these sites, or their collection of information and its use. Please note that this privacy policy applies only to the Ixquick.com website.\nEmail addresses\nWhen you send comments, questions, suggestions, or feedback to Ixquick via email, and include an email address and/or contact information Ixquick may use this information to respond to you. Ixquick will not sell or disclose your contact information to any third parties. We may, however, very occasionally send emails to our users regarding Ixquick company information. This service is opt-in and includes the option to unsubscribe.\nChildren Under 13 Years of Age\nIn light of the concern over protecting children's privacy online, Ixquick does not knowingly request, collect, or share personally identifiable information from users under the age of 13.\nInformation Sharing\nIxquick does not share personal information with any third party search engine or the provider of its sponsored results. Click here for details. Ixquick only shares personal information with third parties when obligated to do so by law (e.g. official court order or subpoena), or to protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Ixquick, its users or the general public as required by law.Operator\n                  Ixquick.com is owned and operated by Surfboard Holding BV, Postbus 1079,  3700 BB ZeistThe Netherlands.
