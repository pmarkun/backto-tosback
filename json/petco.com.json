If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from \"http\" to \"https.\" (Please note: some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers, so you would be unable to connect to our servers to place an order.)\r\n                                \r\n\r\n                            \r\n                                \r\n\t\r\n                                    California Privacy Rights\r\n                                    \r\n                                    Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information with respect to the types of personal information the business shares with third parties for direct marketing purposes by such third party and the identities of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year. Under California law, California residents who have an established business relationship with Petco, may choose to opt out of Petco disclosing personal information about them to third parties for marketing purposes.\r\n                                \r\n\r\n                            \r\n                                \r\n\t\r\n                                    Privacy Policy\r\n                                    \r\n                                    At petco.com, we are concerned with protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to provide a personalized shopping experience. We may also use it to tell you about special offers that we think you'd appreciate if you are subscribed to our newsletters. You'll never have to worry about receiving a barrage of unexpected email from us if you have not subscribed with us. We will not sell, rent or trade your information.\r\nWe occasionally have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures that perform functions on our behalf. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of the data. They are restricted from using this data for other purposes, and in any way other than to provide the requested services to petco.com, and may not alter or resell the data. You may elect to opt-out of personally identifiable site tracking activity by following the Opt-out link below. Keep in mind that petco.com may continue to collect anonymous aggregate site behavior from our customers. Opt-out\r\nWe may occasionally have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates or joint ventures offer promotions on petco.com. You have the option to specifically opt-in to participate in the promotion and share your personal data with these parties and petco.com. These promotions may be in the form of a survey, contest or a separate area offering you the opportunity to enter your data for the specific purpose of participating in that program or promotion. Data collected by these third-parties will be covered under the third-party's Privacy Policy agreement.\r\nThere is a possibility that petco.com, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures, its affiliates, or any combination of such, could merge with, acquire, or be acquired by another business entity. If such an action occurs, petco.com would like to let you know that some or all of the personal information collected about you would be shared with this entity in order to continue to provide reliable service. Notice of such an event will be posted on this page, and we will require that all parties follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy unless otherwise noted.\r\nWhen registering with petco.com, we will ask for some contact information, such as your name and email address. We will use the customer contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and some of our partners. If you do not wish to receive future mailing, see the \"Choice/Opt-Out\" section below.\r\nSometimes you will provide us with data that doesn't reveal your personal identity - what type of pet you're interested in, for example. We use this sort of information for editorial and personalization purposes, and occasionally for other internal purposes (maybe we'll show cat owners a certain ad, for example) but we do not connect it to any name, address or other personal identifying information. This way we can give you customized information without compromising your privacy.\r\nWe reserve the right to use aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group. For instance, we might report to potential advertisers that a certain percentage of our users are interested in parrot behavior, based on online surveys or other requests.\r\nWe use a third party agent to handle our email marketing and you may refer to their privacy policy here.\r\nIf we know a visitor is under the age of thirteen, we will collect a parent's permission offline (by postal mail, fax or phone) before we collect or share personal information with anyone else.\r\nPlease note that nowhere on the website do we knowingly collect contact information or financial information from children under the age of 13.\r\nEmail Notice\r\nEmail, in general, is not a secure form of communication, and can be intercepted as it travels across the Internet.  DO NOT send credit card numbers or other sensitive information via email.\r\nNotice and Procedures for Making Claims of Copyright or Other Intellectual Property Infringements \r\npetco respects the intellectual property of others and takes the protection of copyrights and all other intellectual property very seriously, and we ask our users to do the same.  We therefore employ measures to prevent copyright and other intellectual property infringement on the Site.  Pursuant to Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(2), if you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright or other intellectual property infringement, please send a written notification of the claimed copyright or other intellectual property infringement to:\r\nCopyright Claims\r\nPetco Law Department\r\n9125 Rehco Road\r\nSan Diego, CA 92121\r\n(F) 858.202.7882\r\n(E) Law@petco.com \r\nUnder Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(3)(A), to be effective the notification must include substantially the following information:\r\n\r\nA physical or electronic signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property interest that is allegedly infringed;\r\nIdentification of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed, or if multiple copyrighted works or other intellectual property on the Site are covered by the notice, a representative list of such works;\r\nIdentification of the material that you claim is infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;\r\nInformation reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as your name, address, telephone number and email address;\r\nA statement by you that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or other intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law; and\r\nA statement by you that the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright or other intellectual property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or other intellectual property owner\u2019s behalf. \r\n\r\nFor clarity, only notices related to copyright or other intellectual property infringement should go to the Petco Law Department; any other feedback, comments, requests for technical support, and other communications should be directed here.

We use contact data from our surveys to send users information about petco.com and our promotions. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the \"Choice/Opt-Out\" section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitors' experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. \r\n\r\nFrom time to time we may conduct contests or other promotions or request material for publication. To participate, you usually must supply us with your true identity, which you agree to have publicly associated with your submission. The exact rules vary from case to case, and will be noted clearly on the relevant pages. Your participation will always be voluntary and knowing. Contact information will be used in order to notify contest winners.\r\n                                \r\n\r\n                            \r\n                                \r\n\t\r\n                                    Cookies and How We Use Them\r\n                                    \r\n                                    You may have read about \"cookies,\" nuggets of information that a Web site you visit will store on your own computer.

As mentioned earlier, for certain purposes we may use anonymous, aggregated data about our users. Kids' information may be included in this aggregated data, but will not be personally identifiable. Children must ask their parents or guardians for permission before visiting petco.com or purchasing anything from petco.com. It is also recommended that children get permission before sharing personal information (such as name, address, phone number, or email address) over the Internet.\r\n                                \r\n\r\n                            \r\n                                \r\n\t\r\n                                    Choice/Opt-Out\r\n                                    \r\n                                    When registering with petco.com, we will ask for some contact information, such as your name and email address.
